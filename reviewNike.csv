review
"As soon as I received them, I put them on.  I was absolutely amazed.  They fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable.  I kept them on for a full<br/>9 hours and they still felt good.  Very good foot support.  Overall, an absolute thumbs up to Nike.  I do highly recommend both the shoe and the supplier."
"I have another pair of these Nike's in the exact same size (12D) and they are much wider. Beware sizing is narrow! These pinch my small toe on each shoe, other than that they are comfortable. I didn't notice the pinching when I tried them on and walked around the house on carpet. This issue didn't come up until after I had worn them out shopping and had been walking in them on a hard surface. Otherwise I would have returned them. I'm hoping to stretch them out by wearing them a few times with thick socks, if not I'll be out $55."
"My husband loves these, he wears a 4E and has never been able to find Nike's that are wide enough and the toe area is rounded so he's happy.<br/>This is his second pair, I waited to get another pair for him to switch shoes daily.  They take a beating and still look good."
"I'm very Familiar with the Nike Air Monarch line, been wearing them for over a decade. Needed an all black pair this time. Love the fit and comfort, although as a line they can be a bit squeaky. So far though this latest pair has not exhibited that annoyance."
"These replaced a pair of Nike Air Monarchs that I literally wore to death. As comfortable tenny grips go, these are the bom diggity! That's a GOOD thing! These are what I wear 99.9% of the time to be comfortable because they are SO comfortable. And my last pair lasted forever. I don't recall when I bought them but they served me well for a very long time. IE, great value. Of course I would recommend them and no question I would buy them again - just DID."
"last pair was listed as 6-13 (lasted a long time)this pair  9--27-16 made on date.both pairs have the same product number and fit the exact same way.Both pairs are prefect stable shoes, good for a treadmill.These shoes  make a squeeky noise first day out of the box, the same as 3 years back it does weird me out but goes away quickly  and worse case baby powder them once is all that is needed. bought em this week."
"These shoes were an interesting buy quite some time ago. I’ve had them for about 3 years; but there is one thing I noticed a while into having them, the Squeaking. A few months into having the shoes they began squeaking and though I was a frequent walker back then, it didn’t bother me as much. I usually had headphones or other apparel covering my ears when I went out to walk. They were very comfortable for quite a lot of time; I did outgrow them nonetheless. I still have them to this day; and they are intact. I believed them to be good shoes; with minor issues.<br/><br/>If you don’t mind the squeaking and want the comfort more than anything;<br/><br/>Verdict: I recommend these."
"This shoe provides extremely good cushioning of the heel and sole and provides great support.  The vinyl/leather upper allows the shoe to hold snugly without the need for frequent re-tying.  For me, it holds its fit much better than a mesh upper.  As a result of the great fit, cushioning, and support, my plantar fasciitis symptoms began to disappear only a few days after I started wearing these shoes around the house all day.<br/><br/>The shoe really looks great too.  I bought the white version that has a large silvery Nike swoosh on each side and black accents in various locations.  It's a more adult look than the wild colors favored by teens.  I've had this shoe before, and I know from experience that it cleans up really well and retains a like-new look for a long time.<br/><br/>The only caution is that this shoe doesn't breathe like a shoe with a mesh upper, so they can make your feet hot if they stay on too long in a warm room.  But this is just part of the standard trade-off between a less-sturdy and quickly dirty mesh shoe compared to a less breathable solid upper.  For me, I wear this shoe almost all day, but I switch to a cooler mesh shoe for my work-outs at the gym.<br/><br/>By the way, the black version of this shoe is a comfortable thing to wear to work for places that permit casual attire."
"I've tried several different shoes, makers and styles. Nothing fits as well or feels as good as these shoes. My arches dropped years ago and these are the only shoes that give support, 15 years I've been wearing these shoes....love them!!"
fits true to size. Matches the size of all other Nike shoes that are owned.  It is about half a size smaller than most rebook brand shoes.<br/>Very comfortable. Used for all day and a little CC running.
"Have had trouble finding comfortable shoes since I had both my knees operated on. These nikes solved my back, foot and knee pain problems. Need to replace them at proper intervals and Amazon had reasonable prices and Prime shipping that took less than 48 hours for delivery! Wow!"
"The Monarch is for casual runners.  It is well constructed.  I bought this because I like the way they look.  I am re-starting my running program and decided the Monarch would work.  If you are in to distance running, a better (more expensive model) shoe is advisable; however, this shoe fits my niche.<br/><br/>Updated.... Just bought another ""replacement"" pair.  The originals were fairly worn out.  Did not do much running with them; however, performed a bit of cross training as well as casual wear with them.  Liked them enough to get the same pair again.  No change on original recommendation."
"The shoe is well made and it does fit as expected.  The problem I have with it is that it's a bit clunky and heavy.  I've run into this before with Nike, but with the ""Air"" in the name I thought it'd be okay.  Oh well......it's still a good shoe, just not great like you'd expect from a company like Nike."
A fantastic fit in a 4 E shoe with a more rounded toe which allows the toes to stay straight.  Nothing like some others which pinch the toes together to fit into a medium with toe cup.  My new go to rec. and home shoes for sure.
"These were a choice I made out of four brands, that were black and similar. I hadn't had a pair of Nike's in a while. So, I chose these. The arrival of the shipment got here ahead of schedule. The shoes I've learned to love. However, shame on amazon, for once again, I read false description. No leather uppers here. Like I said, I learned to love these Nike's. I was going to return them. However, not a conscious choice of mine. I learned that a synthetic upper for Nike, is in a class all by itself. These shoes work well for me. If there is any leather in the construction of this shoe, it certainly is not on the visible upper."
"Air Monarch's are the only tennis shoe I can wear because it has a really deep heel cup. I've never ordered shoes on line before, but I'm glad I did! These fit perfect and I've never seen this color pattern in Big 5 before."
I love the comfort level the shoes provide. I have a black pair from several years ago size 10 1/2 and I can't wear socks with them anymore too tight. When I purchased these I got a size 12 and they're fantastic like clouds for my feet love them.
I did not like the idea of buying shoes without trying them on first !!!!! But in my neighborhood almost all the stores do not have wide width shoes !!!! so I took the leap and WOW heaven !!!!! THANK YOU !!!!!! :)
"I have had the Nike Monarch shoes before and love them. However,  the last time I tried to buy some I was told that they were currently not available &amp; I ended up taking some other Nikes that I really don't like at all. When I saw that the Nike Monarchs were available again I promptly bought a pair on line. I have a wide foot &amp; the Nike Monarch 4E shoes are just what I need &amp; enjoy wearing."
Great pair of shoes and they fit my wide feet great. I have extra wide feet from years of wearing boots in the military so it's hard for me to find a good fitting shoe. These do the job well and fit as expected.
"I work as a nurse so I am on my feet ALL DAY constantly and these shoes are amazingly comfortable to work in. I originally had a pair of  Nike Air Monarch that I wore for over 4 years before replacing them with a pair of shoes that were more flashy and man was that a mistake. The 'flashy' shoes cramped my feet so bad and gave me corns...lol so I decided to go back to the shoes that I was familar with and reordered the newer updated verison of the Monarchs.<br/><br/>They are so comfortable it feels like I am walking on air, I love these shoes! The only complaint I have about these shoes are that they squeak horribly whenever it rains or snows and gets wet at the bottom....  everyone can hear me coming a  mile away and know it's me before they phyisically see me. This may be the only complaint I can think of, otherwise I would highly recommend this shoe if you want something comfortable and don't care about the bland style and can withstand the squeak because it will squeeeeeeeeeeak..<br/><br/>SELLER shipped very quickly as well!"
"Have purchased New Balance for YEARS because of thei extra wide EEEE shoes but not anymore....these fit like a glove and I never even tried them on, just ordered them and hoped for the best. Excellent in every aspect..... no more NB for me......ever....."
Purchased these for my dad for work. He loves them! This was his replacement pair. This is the newer style from which he had. He says the comfort is the same and that he is very happy. Will order again.
"Been wearing for 3 weeks and I am very happy with them.<br/>Have been wearing $130 shoes up to this to get good Arch support but these give almost as good at less than half the price, would buy again."
Glad to have found a place that has 4E Nike Shoes. These shoes are so comfy. I have a pair of the red/white ones that I wear all the time. Found this black pair that I can wear at work. So nice to be able to wear such great shoes at work. Don't go home with a back ache any more.
"I bought these to replace a pair of  Nike-Xccelerator-TR-Men-Running-Shoes that treads finally wore out and fell apart on.  These seem to be very similar.  I like the ""shoe horn"" loop saves mashing the heals"
"My new favorite Nike ! So glad I decided to get them , couldnt find my regular Nike's I usually get in my size. saw these and took a chance so glad I did . One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn."
"Slightly narrow around the front and middle section of my foot, but not so much I can't wear them. The first time I wore them they felt tight but the next time was less noticeable, and now they seem okay overall. Ironically, the heel area feels a tad loose, so that part of my foot moves up and down a lot when I walk. It's not like the shoe falls off or anything, though it sort of feels like I could ""walk out"" of them whenever I take a step (I never have). I like the look and comfort is fine now. Slightly better grip between the back of foot/heel and shoe would be better, but not a major issue."
"Due to diabetic neuropathy in my feet I usually buy shoes that are one size too large and 4e width. These are the only training shoe I have found in 4e width.<br/>  I've 4 pair of these over the last few years and find them to be of high quality, but they do tend to slip on the ice a little in the cold weather. If not for this I would have given 5 stars"
"I have been buying new balence for the past 3 years, I decided to make the switch to these Nike monarch and I couldn't be more happy.<br/>First off I have wide flat feet, new balance seemed to be one of the only brands to give the wide option on almost all of their shoes. They are great, but these Nikes feel much better made, they are very light weight and the arch support is extremely good. For being a 6 foot tall 270 lb guy I go through shoes quite fast. I will update this review if anything goes wrong with these shoes. These are comfortable and awsome"
I finally was able to get this shoe in a size 4E. The extra wide size is perfect for my feet. The fit is comfortable. And the air in the soles gives a nice cushion for running and/or walking.
"...bought these to replace 2 pairs of Skechers that each only lasted 6 months before starting to come apart...these are<br/>comfortable, fit is great, and I'm hoping to get at least a year out of them before buying another pair..."
Was happy to find these here. Go through a pair often as they are my main shoe I wear 10 hours a day at work. Very comfortable. AlsO wear them in white at home but need black for work.
"I don't usually order on line for my husband because he is hard to please.  He was happy with this shoe and they fit good, thanks this will save me a lot of time going from store to store."
I tried over and over to send these shoes back because they  were to small. I was ignored  ... so I was stuck with a pair if shoes I can only wear when I want look like I just got a new pair of shoes. Believe me I can't wait to get home to take them off. Thanks for nothing.
Have bought this shoe for years for work. I walk a lot and unlike many other style sneakers it never changes. Can stand all day on asphalt and cement with tired legs but no pain !
I love these shoes!  I live in a rural area and they are hard to find.  I was thrilled when I was told to check out AMAZON.  The price was reasonable and the shoes fit exactly as they should.  I have a wide foot and it is difficult to find my width in the local stores.  I will be purchasing more from this site in the future.
"This is my 2nd pair of these shoes. Had the 1st pair for 6 months before the reknowned squeaking began. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the squeaking to stop even after applying baby powder to the insole as some previous reviewers had indicated helped them.<br/><br/>Bought them again because the fit is perfect for my extra wide feet. That being said, I also purchased some Dr. Scholl's insoles which I am hoping will help alleviate any potential for future squeaking - or at least get me more than six months of usage this time around."
"I have somewhat narrow feet with an arch. These are very, very comfortable standing or walking. The tongue is thick with padding. When I tie them my feet are totally wrapped in a tight, padded cocoon. I have an unopened pair in the closet just in case they discontinue them."
"The shoe felt good and wore good… for about 2 months.  Now, the sole is releasing and falling apart.  Sadly, I now have to buy another shoe.  I would not recommend this shoe at all if you need a good dependable shoe."
"My husband is a standard size 11 with med width . He has 2 previous pairs of these shoes. Since they have worked so well in the past we reordered as he started a xmas job at the post office- Totally disappointed. Toe box is too tight, squeezed the top of toes. Didn't even keep them they were so obviously not going to work. May have to go to 11.5 HOWEVER , never have had to do this before and am not confident this is a solution. Seems this pair is off or the manufacturing has changed ???"
They are a little tight but I am sure they will stretch as I use them. They are replacing a pair that is about 3 years old and I expect they were tight in the beginning of use
Bought for husband and they fit very well. He has a tall arch and it's hard to find shoes that fit. These are very well made and look great after many months of hiking and walks.
"I just spent a week at a conference wearing these shoes... they passed the test. I must've averaged 20,000 steps per day and my feet survived.<br/><br/>Oh, they also look sharp!"
"Best pair of tennis shoes I've ever had! Perfect fit, and very comfortable! This was actually the second pair I've bought. The older one I use for mowing, painting, and doing things in dirty places, and the other one for sports. Two of my friends have the same pair (different sizes) and are also very pleased with these. Totally recommend them!<br/><br/>P.S. The first pair I bought about 2 years ago, and they're still in pretty good condition, just dirty."
"At first, this shoe fit well, although was wider than expected. However, the heel material on one of the shoes got compacted after less than two months, which caused my foot to move too far forward and my toes rubbed constantly. I had to throw them away."
"These shoes fit too tightly, were heavy, and too hard.  There were generally uncomfortable for me so I returned them.  Amazon, however, had an excellent return policy."
My brother love this nike.
Fantastic shoes. Usually My husband has problem getting the right fit shoes and this one really satisfied him. We already recommended to friends. Arrived on time.
Fit was smaller than my last pair. I had to return them for full refund. Slightly disappointed with Nike. Quality is not as consistent as it once was. Probably my last pair of Nike.
"This is about my 5th pair, I have them in different colors also, my family call me the Imelda Marcos of gym shoes because I have about 30 pairs, if I don't like them I give them away to my brothers and best friend all the same size as me. But keep my Nike Airs"
Great fit. Very comfortable.
"For the second time in the last year I have had UPS deliver a package to the wrong address.  In both cases the items were properly addressed and labelled. but for reasons known only to the driver, the deliveries were made to houses down the street.  In the first case the house was obviouly vacant but under renovation.  The only reason I actually got the item was that I saw a box looking like the one I was expecting, fortunately a little outside the ordinary, and went up to check the label just as one of the workman came out and spotted the delivery.  I was able to claim the item based on my name and address, and while I would like to think that the individual would have gotten it to me anyway, who knows.  With this latest item, I was fortunate that the delivery went to a friends house across the street and down the block.  As soon as she saw my name and address she gave me a call and I was able to go over and pick it up. I don't know what is going on with UPS, but it makes me very vigilant if they are supposed to be delivering anything to me and I will not ship with them at this time."
I've had about 6 pairs of these and they always fit and are very comfortable<br/>I walk from 3 to 5 miles a day at work and am on my feet about 8 of the 10 hours<br/>They have not let me down yet
"I have tried once after I get it. It feels comfortable and sporty. However I have not tried outside. I may update this comment after hiking, or jugging or running atleast once."
"I have always worn 9D without a problem.  These<br/>Hurt the side and top of foot. I walk on cement<br/>Floors and would be perfect if top and side did<br/>Hurt.  I have been wearing Rockport for years<br/>With any problems, but nikes soles are better.<br/>Made in China."
My husband loves these for delivering mail. They are not the most fashionable choice for footwear but then you need support and comfort you have to make sacrifices. This is the 2nd pair I have ordered in 2 months because he loves them so much he wanted a backup for rainy weather.
"I adore these shoes, it so hard to find wide shoes that aren't ugly, and the price is amazing for name brand shoes. A must have for all adults with wide feet."
"Great shoes, months later they have held up and still look and feel great. Nikes are Nikes. Grab two pairs if you can, your feet and your wallet will not regret it."
"The shoes began squeaking, popping, creaking and making audible noise almost immediately. They are virtually unwearable now.<br/>Perhaps they are Chinese knock-offs? Do not buy these shoes"
My husband has been wearing these particular shoes for years. They are hard to find and I was so glad to find them on Amazon. He loves the way they fit.
"These are by far the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I've ever worn in my entire life. Yes, that bad. If I could give negative stars, I would."
It is hard to have a 2e foot width to be comfortable in affordable shoes. I am glad to run into any wide width shoe because it feels so much better.
"So far so good. Comfortable. Hope they last / So after a few weeks of wearing these shoes, yes I should have went up a 1/2 size, now they squeak to no end. They squeak every step I take and no matter on what type of flooring. You can hear me coming a mile away. Very Very displeased with that. I wonder if its only my shoes?"
"My husband loves them. This is his 4th pair. Since he is a diabetic, being able to get them wide is a must to protect his feet and toes. Will keep on buying."
"Bought them for running because they were listed as running shoes. Definitely not for running. I bought a pair of downshifters for running (which are awesome btw). At first I was concerned because they look like 'dad shoes' to me. But I where them to work on casual days and to walk around in when I know I'm going to do a lot of walking. Very comfortable and they have some style, had a few compliments from people who pay attention to things like that, so I'm happy with the purchase."
"I have worn Nike shoes for years and I have never been disappointed.  These were as described.  They are very comfortable and required very little ""break in."""
I like the shoe and have had this same shoe before.  I ordered the exact same shoe by the number on the tongue but for some reason it was not quite the right size.  It was about 1/4 inch smaller in the toe width.  I had to return them because they were just too tight.
Love these shoes. I have a pair that is wore out but they feel so good i use them as outside working around the farm shoes ... I can not get rid of them ... lol
They're very comfortable on my feet I had these sneakers before and I love the so much I wore them out so I had to purchase another pair
"Shoes were ordered, as the same brand, same style, and size. However these seem to be smaller in the toe area and are tight in that region."
"I wear size 8 shoe -orderd size 8 -normal width  .I m 5'7"" -130 lbs . They fit perfect . Little snug at first as are all new shoes . Hope this helps with concerning ordering a size larger issue ."
My son has worn nothing but these shoes (in different sizes as he's grown) for the last couple of years. Sturdy and comfortable.
"Great shoe, second pair ordered in a year. Hold-up well, comfortable. I wear size 13, and am 270 lbs. They provide good support."
I had to get these since my foot is so wide. Fit great and feel awesome. Would really like it if Nike offered some more widths in other styles.
"Grandson said ""Oh, Wow"" when he saw them and ""They're so comfortable ""when he wore them. His school uniform code requires all black shoes so he used a Sharpie to color the white letters on the shoe tongue. Perfect shoe for an active eighth grader."
"I started buying Nike Monarchs many years ago. Now I buy no other athletic shoe (except for running). A great shoe for everyday casual use and long walks. I use my old pairs for yard work, working on the car, etc. I have a hard time throwing them out. They are pretty durable. Great Casual Styling for us Middle Aged Men. This was my 11th pair I think. I usually have both Black/White &amp; White (with Blue Nike Emblem) styles. They have 3 different styles but I never did like a Total Black Shoe. But if you do they have them. Highly recommended."
"I am a nurse working in a hospital so I'm on my feet all day. I am tall and medium build and have wide feet. These shoes are comfortable, I just wish I could get them a little wider than the 4e. I wear a size thirteen and ordered the 4e, they cramp my pinky toe just a little bit but it's better than the other brands I have tried so far. If I could get them a bit wider I would give it 5 stars."
i've worn this model and brand for years.  Always high quality and perfect fit every time including this time.  Perfect!
"A bit hard on my feet ,on my  first outing in them. I love the look and style even though they are mens , they are what I wanted."
"I have been wearing Nike Air Monarch for years.  I walk 800 miles a year and I go through a couple of these excellent shoes each year. I keep them in stock at home. When I find them on sale I usually buy a couple at a time. Best bank for the buck, for sure."
"My dad has worn these for years and years. After trying on his old beat up pair, I decided to get myself some. His latest pair are two years old, so they are beat up on the outside, but still as comfortable as my new ones. I thought the 10.5 4e might be a bit to wide for me, but they fit great. A little extra room is better than them being too tight(like most nikes). These might be my new everyday shoes. I'll update my review after I break them in a bit. Won't take long as I walk 5-10 miles a day."
"Very comfortable.  I generally have to wear an orthodox in my shoes, except for these.  I just love these shoes. They hold up very well."
"I finally found the right size. But these are listed as a running shoe, and it was ""heavy"" like a walking shoe. I'm used to the<br/>lighter weight of a running shoe. These were returned and I then found another running shoe on Amazon which is a keeper.<br/><br/>4 star rating is based on the shoe wearing like a walking weight shoe which I have worn before."
"The company providing the shoes was great.  However, I've been buying the air monarchs for many years because they have always been the most cushioned, comfortable shoe I ever wore.  That is no longer the case.  The insole is no different from any other now, so the shoes are not worth the money paid."
"These shoes are very comfortable. I wear them nine hours a day on concrete working as an automotive technician. It's only been three days since I've been wearing them, but they have far exceed my expectations. They are awesome. Very light and fit as expected. I wear an 11 in other Nike shoes so I orederd a pair of 11 in these and they fit perfect. No more sore feet and legs every day from the boots I've been wearing prior. I would highly recommend these shoes for anyone in need of shoes for work especially if working on cement."
"#3 was the charm for me. I had tried two different brands before I finally found these Nike that fit me to a T.  I have had issues with shoes for the last few years and it's getting on my nerves. It shouldn't be this hard to find something I like, but it has become that. I get mens' shoes because I have wide and flat feet. Most womens' shoes are very uncomfortable, they feel like a vice on my feet. And I'm not going to put up with that. I don't know what's wrong with designers &amp; clothiers these days, but they are sure making crap. Those of us who can't afford a new wardrobe every season need to revolt. Clothing should fit the person, not the person fit the clothes. I'm not ashamed of my size. And I don't know why EVERYONE is trying to make me feel bad. I will go to Nike from now on."
Needed extra support after total knee replacement these sneakers were perfect.  Great comfort and cushion.  Have purchased in several colors since the fit is so awesome.
These are the best all around shoe there is! I cannot even guess how many pairs I have purchased over the years
A really good running shoe.  Very stable. At first I thought it was a little heavy but I have gotten used to it. I recommend them for runners with wide feet.
"Comfortable, good sole and inner sole.  Have worn this make for several years -- hope they keep making them."
"I walk a lot for my job and I got a pair of these about 2 years ago and they were great! About 2 weeks ago, the padding started to fail, so I went to buy another pair but I could not find them, they were out of stock.. so I tried 2 other pair of shoes and ended up returning both pair and I got very lucky because I ended up finding a place on Amazon that had the Nike's in stock and I got another pair. Great shoe, and they fit great!"
This is the 2nd pair of this shoe I have and I really like the fit and feel. The first pair lasted me for years.
"Great tennis shoes, I've ordered these before and they hold up well. Way better than New Balance shoes"
"The overall fit both width and length of the shoes was too small.  Have worn this size of shoe for years.  On a rare occasion do I find a particular brand and style of shoe to be too small even though the size selected was correct; in this case, returned shoes and ordered next size up."
I bought these for my father. He loved them! The price was decent and affordable for the quality as well.
Look good and feel right. Not a runner but a walker and are great for that. Good support.I like them.
Awesome!
"Great sneakers that are loved so much, it's a repeat buy with this being the 3rd pair! He loves them."
"I don't usually buy clothes nor shoes online because I'm always afraid they won't fit correctly since I'm not in the States and the measurements are different, but after I made some research I decided to do the leap of faith and I'm glad I did. The quality of the materials is top notch and the shoes fit like a glove"
"I HAVE BEEN WAITING AWHILE FOR AMAZON TO GET THESE SHOES. THEY SEEM TO BE THE ONLY SHOES THAT FIT MY FEET RIGHT. AS A MATTER OF FACT THE ONLY SHOE BESIDES BOOTS THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN AT LEAST 5 YEARS. I WISH I WOULD'VE GOT 2 BUT WAS WORRIED BOUT SIZE. NOW AMAZON IS OUT AND I HAVE TO PAY MORE AND SHIPPING FOR ANOTHER PAIR BUT THE 10 EXTRA DOLLARS ISN'T MUCH CONSIDERING I'LL HAVE THE RIGHT SHOES FOR MY FEET FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THESE ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND BUILT TO LAST. THEY LOOK GREAT, FEEL GREAT AND I'M KICKING MYSELF WE KNOW WHERE FOR NOT GETTING 2 PAIRS RIGHT AWAY. ANYWAY, THANK YOU AMAZON FOR FINALLY HAVING THESE. I WILL KEEP CHECKING AND REST ASSURED I WILL BE BUYING MORE WHEN AMAZON HAS THEM."
"dont get me wrong, the material is great, and the design is good, but i didnt like it because in addition that it feels somewhat large, it is buffy, meaning that it gives extra size to its look<br/>i became reluctant of buying Nike unless trying them out in a store and see how it would look like. running with this cause scratches to my legs cause i run narrow. it is good to wear it when not needed to do anykind of exercise"
This is about the 4th time that I have purchased these shoes.  The other purchases were done from Penneys.  They no longer appear to carry my size (square feet) in stock.
"I've had two different pairs of Nike Air and this is my third.  There is a slight difference in the quality of the leather, perhaps because each pair was made in a different factory, from Indonesia, Vietnam, and China.  This latest pair is from China and with many other products from China the quality does have telltales.  Other than that its too soon to tell about its performance and its durability &amp; longevity."
"I love mine ,  the fit was right just what i had ordered .  I sometimes have trouble finding shoes to fit right.  Either i have to get shoes to big to get them wide enough or suffer from wearing a shoe that is to tight.  That is not a problem wi these at all.  As for the wide width or should i refer to the idea of people who need a wide width shoe,  the Nike Air Monarch IV (4E) are highly recomended in my book."
"I needed a solid black tennis shoe and this fits the bill. Comfortable, nice looking shoes."
"Good shoes, so hard to find good brands of shoes in extra wide. These seem to be built very well."
I have been wearing Air Monarch for years but like the black and white look of this shoe.
"I bought these for my husband, and although I knew they were the same ones he's bought before from our local mall, I was nervous they wouldn't fit right, and would possibly be too wide.  However, we both have been pleasantly surprised as they fit perfectly and were priced better than going to the mall for them, not even taking into account the aggravation of driving there &amp; fighting for a parking spot, and dealing with the mall crowd! Thank you!!"
Size was as expected - perfect fit.  Quality was very good so this is a product I would highly recommend.
Great pair of shoes. Very comfortable and they look good too. Very heavy and a big shoe though.
"Heavy, with annoying seams along the toe box. Returned after wearing for an hour. Ouch.,"
"Pretty great shoe, but material isnt superb, for 60 bucks its ok, worth more like 40-50 though."
Got theses Nikes for my husband and he liked them! They were better for his feet when we stands allot and walks.
i was pleasantly suprises by the comfort and the fit of the shoe. I wear a Castro ankle brace and the 4e shoe fit over the brace. I wore the shoe during Scout summer camp. It was comfortable and held up very well.
"I've been buying these shoes for years. I love them, wife hates them.<br/>I have to say these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned with one caveat, they squeak. I have learned the trick, here actually of silencing them with baby powder on the insoles but squeaks do arise here and there from time to time.<br/><br/>Are they comforatable? VERY Are they annoying? VERY<br/><br/>I've learned to adapt my lifestyle to the needs of my shoe *Snicker*."
"the 4e wide pair fit great. the regular d width was too narrow. 4e is quite wide, and comfortabe. arch support kinda sucks, but i use custom made orthotics so that doesnt affect me, and yes the insoles do come out with very little effort as they are slightly glued down."
This is my second Monarch pair. Very comfortable shoes. Ordering another pair soon.
Husband loves these sneakers. He is on his feet a lot and they are very comfortable
"Good shoes that fit as expected. My only complaint was the soles squeaking when walking. I thought that it would go away with time, but sadly it did not."
"The most comfortable shoe I ever owned! Its like walking on a cloud. They are snug and wrap around my feet with both firmness and comfort. Its always hard for mento find comfortable shoes, these are THEE shoes for me!"
"Hey, these are great for fit and comfort.  My wife bought me another pair of shoes, I couldn't wait til  I could replace em.  The wife calls these my old men shoes.  But hey I am an old man, and I have earned the right to have these shoes."
"I really like these shoes, especially since they have fixed the squeak in this version.  I have wide feet, with a bone spur on little toe and these shoes are very very comfortable all day. I walk at least 4 miles a day.  I have previously always gotten the white color and these are the first black pair Ive had but they fit just as well.  On other brand 4E wide shoes, I have had to cut a slot around the little toe to relieve the pressure but not on these Monarchs."
Good shoe for long term on your feet. Watch out for the soles comming unglued if you work or play in or near water often. I've had some that came apart.
I have worn Nike Air shoes for right at 20 years.  I have never had a pair to squeak........until now!<br/><br/>They are so loud that I cannot sneak up on a concrete stature.<br/><br/>Too late to return to Amazon (I have had them for 39 days) and Nike wants me to take my shoes off my feet and return them for them to evaluate whether they squeak or not.  Two to three week process for a known Nike problem.......they just do not want to admit it!<br/><br/>I guess I have bought my last pair of Nikes
"The shoes have a very firm shape to them, and they are really comfortable in walking in."
Good value. I have to wear this ginormous size and these re better than most.
This shoe is really thick and heavy.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was the front of the shoe. Since there are threads on the front it the shoe rips apart.<br/><br/>Even if you are not a heavy runner I still wouldn't recommend buying this.<br/><br/>Would not buy again.
My favorite athletic shoe. Seller ships ridiculously fast. No trip to the store required and I'm lovin' it!
"A 'HAIR'.  Just a HAIR small maybe.  Many reviewers for example wrote #1. that they fit 'True to size,' while still others wrote #2. 'Fit as expected.'<br/><br/>Okay.  For me that's a tough one because I'm left to wonder 'Did they EXPECT' the shoe to fit a little small, or a little large and also the 'True to size' part.  I say this because I've bought this that or the other thing with experience buying from that manufacturer and I EXPECTED it to fit small or large SO with that it DID fit as expected.<br/><br/>Whereas if I'd never bought a certain brand before and the size chart gave a specific measurement and I gauged my decision to choose some size because of the information in the chart THEN an item DID or DIDN'T fit ... ALSO as 'EXPECTED.  See where I'm going with this?<br/><br/>So, iF you're POSITIVE that you wear a size 11 BUT your foot is maybe 'just' a little wide BUT not so wide that you have to buy an 11 W for example as opposed to 11 D or M.  (U.S.) then you might want to go with an 11.5 or POSSIBLY even a 12 (that is to say then a half to a full size larger.)<br/><br/>I'm serious, I am NOT yanking your chain here.  These are VERY comfortable.  They have a thick sole.  I stand a full one inch taller in these.  They absorb shock quite well also.  I have a pair of Nike SHOX that I paid around $139.00 for.  The Air Monarch here is WAY more comfortable for just walking around AND they're fine for treadmill. (The SHOX ARE better all around for treadmill for me due to the recovery of first my right knee, then my left: so for the ultimate running shoe for rehab, I would recommend the SHOX in tandem with some very good compression knee sleeves for what that's worth.)<br/><br/>If you have no issues, you just want something almost all purpose, not too pricey (VERY affordable in fact) and nice looking (they don't look cheap at all,) I absolutely highly recommend these. At the same time ... I've lost my train of thought because while inserting the previous sentence I managed to delete an entire paragraph...SO the bottom line is that I highly recommend these."
I am very happy to buy this product.<br/>The shipment was very fast and arrived in very good condition.<br/>Thank you.
"Great shoes.  The width runs a little tight, but they are very nice shoes."
"I always keep a spare pair of these sneakers in a fireproof safe in the event of some sort of a natural disaster !!<br/>Seriously, these are the only sneakers I wear. I've been wearing them (different pair) for over 20 years. I wear them for everything from construction work, for athletics, for boating and for dress. They aren't fancy like my kid's and grandkids wear, but they are incredibly comfortable. So I always keep a spare pair on hand."
Seems to be a nice product for the price.  Fits and is well constructed.
Always predictable fit and generally a comfortable sneaker fro the price.
I wear these shoes almost exclusively.  They always work and wear well.
"I love the shoes, but even better I love that they fit when I got them!<br/>I wear a very large shoe, so being able to order them without hunting for a specialty store was a pleasant experience!"
Very comfortable snug fit.  Arrived on time without any damage to box.
I have a white pair of these and a black pair so this time i got a little bit of both. Very comfortable shoe!!!
"I got these because I was tired of Adidas and liked the look.  I have the white/black/red, not the weird looking all black in the picture.  I knew about the squeaking issue, but seemed to be an easy fix.  I tried them on at a local store before ordering from Amazon.  I would have just bought them at the local store, but they were out of my size.  Anyway, these, to me, run a bit small.  I wear 11.5 in almost every brand, but usually need a 12 in Nikes.  These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned, and that includes my current workshoes (Merrill Shiver Moc), which cost well over $100 usually.  Time will tell on the wear and squeak, but after a few days with some heavy walking mixed in, these are great!"
My husband loves these shoes and continues to buy then every time he needs shoes.  Laces are to long though.
There great sneakers fit and last  love them feel awesome on my feet
I have bought these same exact size and width shoes in the blue and white and these ones are a bit smaller. I bought them because they worked so well in the past but I wanted a different color. At first I thought they gave me the wrong width. Ill still wear them but I wont buy this particular one again.
I like this shoe and will probably buy it again.  Comfortable fit.
"Good Fit and wearable right out of the box without a lot of ""break in"" time."
A fantastic shoe. I will be buying more of these in different colors.
these sneakers are good for walking but not jogging as they have air in the heels and it punchers and blows out after a few months.another thing is that they make a horrible squeaky noise after the air blows out of them every time you walk on them.so if you want a regular walking sneaker then they are perfect and are extremely comfortable especially if you have lower back pains.but if your a jogger don't buy these as the air will blow out.
Nice shoes but be sure to order at least a half size bigger than you usually wear.
My son really liked these sneakers years ago.. He asked if maybe they still made them they do.. He was so happy.. very comfortable!
"I've bought multiple pairs of these type of shoes over the last decade. They look good, feel comfortable and are affordable."
"I know how a shoe fits and feels is subjective depending on the particular shoe and individual, but, for me, these are like pillows on my feet. I am wearing one pair now and have four new pair in the closet."
Been through most of the brands of shoes to try to support my arch and put an end to my plantar fasciitis. Bought several other brands before the Nike Air Monarch IV and none of them have the support that these Nikes have. Love these shoes and these are actually my second pair. Superior arch support and snug fit at my correct size. The best part is that my plantar fasciitis is almost completely remedied and I've only had these shoes for a bout a month and half! Definitely will keep these as my daily shoes!
"Used these as work/walking shoes, ~10ish miles a day, 6 days a week. They did eventually fall apart but I've found that these last longer than anything else at similar price points."
"I absolutely love these shoes!  This is probably my 5th or 6th pair of these shoes, and they are by far the most comfortable sneakers I've ever owned.  They wear well for me and definitely feel like you're walking on air.<br/><br/>I typically wear a pair for a 18 to 24 months, and when they get a little ratty, I use the old pair for around the house/yard and purchase a new pair for wearing in public."
Fit perfectly  awesome looking for buying untried off Internet very pleased very comfortable  could not believe how light weight  would definitely recommend to buy
Very comfortable and wide.  Good Quality at a great price.  Will buy these again.
"Still the ""Old Guy"" shoes that are bought for comfort.  I have been buying them for years and most of them have held up well."
"The package arrived in two days, sneakers fit well and were in New Condition! I've spent $65.00 in Khol's for the same pair, a bargain at $49.00.<br/>Dave"
"Really great shoes, in a color combo I couldnt get locally."
"average quality.  But the squeaking problem is annoying, I would buy again."
"Great shoes at a good price.  I was amazed at how quickly they arrived,,,,,,,,,2 maybe 3 days.  I needed a pair of shoes for walking and have owned black monarchs in the past...3 pair....these white shoes are not quite the same but are just as comfortable.  I tried them on and I had very little trouble breaking them in.  The shoes are very comfortable due to the ""air"" and the general great quality of the shoes.  I went to the mall and I couldn't find them at at least 8 stores and I thought  ""what a bummer...my favorite shoes and they don't make them anymore""  I looked on Amazon and there they were and at a very reasonable price."
"They look ""clunky"" with a nice, round toe. That being said, they are comfortable and are great to be in for a day of standing and walking!"
Had several pairs of these and last long and look good with jeans
Shoe fits great just like the ones I get at the store.
Like the style. Works well for me who has flat feet.
Best prices in town - and they fit just as expected.
wear them for work. fits perfect and are comfortable
Great quality at a reasonable price...Arrived early.
"Nice shoe, fairly light weight and the price is also reasonable"
Look great fit great delivery was great - great job
Excellent shoes.  Very comfortable and supportive.
"Ive had these before which is the reason i bought them, yes they are squicky so just add baby powder under the sole and on top and itll fix that, i got the 4E and dont worry about the  4E(M) its just men, they feel like ur on a cloud"
"Love these shoes, fit well and are so comfortable."
I have the shoes for a long time now and they are still holding up good
Love the style. I use it to go to work everyday.
"I own this show right now as a size 11 4E and it was really snug in the beginning.  This new pair is slightly large at a 12 4E, but thicker socks make that issue go away and width-wise is very comfortable.  Good shoe overall, and price is very good compared to retail stores.  Arrived on time, no issue."
"comfortable shoe, and it was just what I wanted."
"I had purchased shoes like this way back 2001 or so and LOVED them.  I always swore how much support they had, not to mention they are very attractive both on and off :).<br/>The support is still amazing for my arch and heels. However, the sizing seems a bit off, maybe just the new leather, but I don't remember them fitting this tightly.<br/><br/>All in all though, very well made shoe."
"My son wears these for work as a bartender. They are sturdy, durable and most important comfortable.  He is on his feet anywhere from 9 to 12 hours at a time and has been wearing these for years and years.  He was looking for an all black shoe and discovered these many years ago.  We are concerned that they will eventually be discontinued so he stockpiles.  He claims they are best shoe for him for any price."
the very best walking shoe and comfy too  M.C.
Love the new shoes.  They fit great. Great price.
"Love the color! These shoes are exactly what I expected. I have purchased these shoes before but in a different color. The fit is as expected. I wish they had more arch support, but all and all a great fit, and I will be buying them again the next time I need shoes."
"Love these shoes! This is about my 6th-7th pair! I wear these everywhere and I'm a teacher! They really help my feet take on the stress of on my feet all day. I have other tpes of shoes and even other types of tennis shoes, but nothing compared to the comfort I get with these!<br/><br/>J M Rogers"
Son's happy with the shoes.<br/><br/>Rich
Second pair of these that I have owned. Great shoe.
I love these shoes - they are so comfortable - I wore out my last pair and these are just a little wider and fit perfectly - I hope they continue to make them (seems like when you find something that works well and you really like it it gets discontinued) I am Old-school and cannot stand all the new products made with mesh sides and tops (garbage in my opinion) These are all leather (very good construction - and they look good) and provide good support for foot and heal. Tenstars from me **********
Love the shoe but after a while they will develop an annoying squawk.  With all the complaints I'm surprised that Nike hasn't solved this problem.
Great fit. Great looking shoe. Amazon come thru again.
The shoes arrived promptly as stated. The size and width were correct and the shoes fit perfectly.
My grandson loved his Nike shoes. Took them out and put them on right away.  Said they were great looking and extremely comfortable 👍; )
"Hard to find a good, simple, supportive white leather sneaker. So nice to find a cold weather alternative to the ubiquitous mesh. Supportive, comfortable, and sharp looking. Good stuff."
"These are the only shoes my husband likes to wear. He works on his feet all day (as a cabinet installer) so these fit as they would in the store. The soles do not offer much support, so he always has to put inserts in. I recently bought a pair for myself, and noticed the soles also needing more support. Overall, a great shoe-- and worth the money."
"I ordered two pair of these shoes and what a mistake I made.  These shoes squeak, groan and moan horribly!  I work in a hospital at night and I can't wear these as intended because they are so loud.  People hear you before they see you, how embarrassing!  And how are you to know this within 60 days?  you don't!"
Fit as expected.  Feels like it will last for awhile  (strong material) yet it's comfortable.
Great Shoe! I am  pleased with these Nike Air Monarch IV. They fit comfortably.
"This is a good shoe.  I use these for general, everyday getting around.  They are my main shoes to wear to work, to go out socially and for hikes and pretty much everything else.  The laces loosen up nicely to let the tongue loosen way up around my high arches and the width is plenty sufficient for the wide area around the ball of my foot.  I recently bought one pair to test them out as they looked a bit different than the similar but not exact same Nike shoe I have been wearing for a few years.  After break in, they are excellent so I bought a second pair in order to give each pair time to breathe or to be washed while the other pair is in use.  Need we say Nike quality is always excellent."
second pair purchased like first so well
Great shoes. Great fit.  Will buy again.
"They are a cool shoe ,thank you amazon☺"
Husband loves these... Always fit well.
Most comfortable shoes for work I've had so far. Love the comfort
"These are a second pair, first bought locally. They are good for my feet bottoms, where I've had issues, and where running and other cross training lighter types just were not cushioned adequately. These are perfect for avoiding that. And they are not heavy for the build. I walk treadmill at 6.0+ elevation, and flexibility is also not an issue. The ""D"" size in these is my wider than average width, while the other models of ""E-4"" etc, were too wide in the store. I waited for two months to be sure the store bought pair were indeed perfect; these from Amazon were true to size, and will last me for years--Grateful to Amazon once again. ~ww"
Nice looking - comfortable - good price!
Feels great on neuropathy. Super comfortable.
My husband is on his feet every day and he loves these shoes - his fourth pair!
"These are the shoes that I will buy for years to come.  Previously, I was a Rockport fan.  The last pair that I ordered through Amazon were TERRIBLE.  My feet hurt badly.  I think it was poor arch support.  I tried these Nike walking shoes and they fit great and feel great.  I need wide shoes. The right shoe was a little tight but expanded a little with a few days of wear and are perfect now.  Very happy now."
Buy them a full size larger and hope they fit.  They aren't returnable after you wear them.  Beware!
It is a good looking show but I normally wear a 9D in most shoes and that is what I ordered but it was too small. I would need a 9 1/2 D in this shoe. I was able to return it with no problem and no return shipping.
"Have bought several pairs of Monarchs.  I have wide feet and the 4Es fit better than nearly every pair of athletic shoes I have tried.  Stand up well to abuse and they just keep going.  They are my everyday shoes, even at work."
Son loves them. Nikes always wear well.
i only were nike. they are great.
These shoes definitely run 1/2 size small at least. This might be a personal issue but I couldn't wear these shoes for more then an hour. There appears to be an inside seam in the construction that crossed my pinkie toes in both shoes and caused severe irritation. This purchase was a waste of money for me as I can no longer wear them.
The fit was just right. The shoe is comfortable.<br/>I wrote a review earlier.
"They look good, feel good, and a good price"
They're beautiful I wish they were wider
shoes arrived on time and fit great
"I've been wearing the Nike Monarch series of shoes for years now.  Until I purchased these they have been the most comfortable and durable shoes I've worn.  Now they're too small, they've developed a squeak when I walk in them and are starting to wear on the bottom.  Very disappointing.  Looks like it's time I find a new brand as my children are also having similar issues with their Nike shoes."
"These are great, well built shoes.  Comfortable and long lasting."
"Great sneakers,very comfortable and log lasting"
Great shoes at a great price
"In the past I've bought less expensive sneakers at Sam's Club or WalMart but  they were not very comfortable nor did they last very long...<br/><br/>This time I wanted something a lot better. I have two two bad knees that need replacing and wanted to ease the pain of walking.<br/>So although I've never had a pair of Nike Air Monarchs, I ordered them in hopes of getting a decent shoe that would make my walking easier.<br/><br/>It was a good decision on my part. With basic standard shipping, the Nikes arrived quickly in just several days. The fit and comfort perfect. I gave these a five star rating for quality, looks, comfort. I'll do it again when I need them."
They  fit perfectly and I PUT my own orthodics in them and very comfortable for my high arches and metatarsal pain.  .no pain now and will buy another  pair of these shoes when I wear these out.
GREAT SHOE &amp; GREAT SERVICE.
Husband loves them great price
"These are my Dad's favorite shoes, this was his 3rd pair. He asks for them every time his old ones wear out"
I am very happy with them.
"I love the Air Monarach IV's since they are comfortable to wear and I am currently wearing my third set of this brand of shoes but this new set has been disappointing.  These new shoes have a squeaking sound when walking, running or even when holding in my hand and the sides are squeezed or the bottom of the shoes are pressed."
Husbands favorite sneaker
Great shoes fast shipping thanks
My son loves these shoes.
