review
"I have two pairs of the Skecher memory foam shoes. I have diabetes and try to take care of my feet. I needed something that was easier on the feet as I do a lot of walking. After going through two pairs of Nike Air Max's because of punctures to the air (yes I am hard on shoes) I tried these. Immediate difference, the wide version of these shoes are perfect for me, and even after three months with the first pair the soles retain their memory foam. I bought the second pair because I am so please with them. I walk about 10,000 steps per day on average and these work perfect. They probably wouldn't do well for running or high impact stuff."
I had to return them because the inside area near the toe was not smooth.  It contained an extension of the tongue which proved uncomfortable.
"Very satisfied with the quality and fit -- However, time will tell because it is too soon to judge quality after wearing them for a short period of time.  I think Amazon misses the obvious when requesting feedback on ordered products.  The real test is after 3 to 6 months of use and then ask the same questions to get a more insightful judgement.  Things may look and feel good at first but remember the movie The Wizard of OZ.  ""Do not pay any attention to the guy behind the curtain.""  In the case of non-clothing products it seems that a fair appraisal of how good the product is would be after two or three years.  This is very true especially in this economy, because no one has the dollars available to buy new constantly."
I brought this shoe for my son usually he wears a 9.5 but this brand I brought 10. He says fits perfect memory foam is comfortable. The style is great and price was even better. I love sketchers brand you can never go wrong with them. This is one of the shoe brands that I buy for my entire family without breaking the bank. Definitely recommend.
"Great pair of shoes and the 4E size fits my feet good. I haven't used them enough yet to evaluate how they would be after several months of use but based on other pairs of skechers I've purchased, they should be good for quite a while.  I would recommend these shoes to anyone with wide feet."
"When I first got these I was kind of blown away by how comfortable the memory foam insole was.  Now after months of use the insole is packed down a bit, but the shoe is still comfortable.  The width of the shoe is as advertised and maybe a tiny bit more, I myself have to take up a bit of slack with the laces so this shoe can accommodate a very broad foot with the 4E size.  So far I've worn it for 6 months and it is holding up admirably.  The fabric covering above the heel near the Achilles tendon is wearing but it shoes no signs of unsheathing a plastic body to slice at me as I have had happen with other brands of shoes.<br/><br/>I plan to purchase other Skechers shoes based on my experience with this pair."
"I bought these because well, I needed a new pair of shoes for work. They have been comfortable since day 1 and really didn't need any break in. The rubber sole is a bit harder than I was expecting but they are still fairly skid RESISTANT. Better traction in the snow than my old shoes even when they were brand new and all day comfort are the reasons I would make this purchase again when they wear out.<br/><br/>I don't know what happened with the other reviewers but I've worn them daily for the past couple months and aside from the logo wearing off the insole there is practically no wear showing and all the stitching still looks perfectly intact"
Husband said they are very comfortable. Nice looking and a good price too. Gives him a little lift on life too. It gives him like an extra 1/2 inch in height. He is only 5'9' and I am 5'10'. He noticed that right away. Must be from the memory foam. Hope they keep their height :-)
"These shoes lasted longer then usual, I work on a rough concrete floor and shoes usually last 6 months before falling apart.<br/>I am now on the 8th month and the soles are still in usable shape.<br/>The memory foam part does not work it was basically a foam ""sticker"" that peeled off within a few days."
"I have bought two pairs of these shoes in local stores (on sale both times) prior to ordering through Amazon.  The price through Amazon is lower than the sale prices I have paid in the past.  The shoes fit as expected and are comfortable right out of the box.  The second pair I bought wore out on the inside, back of the shoe, right down to the hard plastic lining.  The rest of the shoe showed no wear."
"Great pair of shoes, I'm a bigger guy and found the memory foam nice. I have been using them 3 to 4 times a week for the past 6 months and they are holding up. even the foam has not crushed down. Only minor issue I have are a few thread strands have started to come loose but the integrity seems sound."
"I tried these on at a store but the price was crazy, checked on Amazon and they were a great price.  Arrived within days,  they fit perfectly and I plan to buy these again when needed. I habe narrower feet and they are super comfortable."
"This is my second pair, same style slight variation on color I have bought. I purposefully bought as a neutral style to match my summer shorts. I don't normally run around in pink shoes.😀  Great support and comfort if you are still on the go. I have been a sketcher fan for some years now. I would recommend this product especially at the currant price. I paid $40 + online. Great bargain."
"I got these because they featured ""wide tips"". My other sneakers were squeezing my toes. These do not squeeze the toes, but they are heavier than my previous sneakers. That's a fair tradeoff my painful big does were impacting my running."
"This 14w fit perfect! My husband loves the memory foam support insole &amp; stable heel. The shoe is nicer than the pic shows. We ordered a second pair! When a shoe fits my husband with great support, I order a backup pair for later on!"
"These Skechers are very comfortable. Wish they were a little wider.  Took a lot of time to stretch out for the comfort, but for the first time in a good two years almost all my heel pain is gone.  If width was wider I would give a five star for sure. Good Value for the price."
"Comfortable shoes.  Lost a star only because the grey rubber over-molded to the cleats is peeling off in little chunks.  That doesn't affect the fit or function of the shoe, just cosmetic and annoying.  Worn mostly indoors in a shop environment and they are very comfortable, even after 8+ hours on my feet."
"Had a similar pair of Sketchers that I liked, ordered the same size, they fit great (as did my last pair) and I'm very happy with them so far, If they last as long, or longer than my last pair I will be very happy, I paid much less than the local stores were asking for similar sketchers."
Well this my 4th pair of similar Sketcher shoe.  I live in the jungle in Hawaii and work in this shoe all day long out doors. I do water proof the shoe before wearing them and it seems to make them last longer and stay pretty clean.
"Have purchased Sketchers in the past with very positive results,however these are cheaply made and do not fit right.. I seldom have issues with shoe size, but in this case they are extremely uncomfortable especially on inclines.."
"All day pounding asphalt at work, these shoes are great. After a few months, at which point cheap shoes are falling apart and have been retired to mowing the lawn, these shoes are still in excellent shape, except for the cushion sole in the heel area. It begins to wear away and becomes a hole in the sole. I tried replacing the inner sole, but haven't found a suitable insole as comfortable as the factory ones. The outer sole has worn evenly and has not split open or cracked as most sneakers would. I will keep buying these shoes for the comfort factor and durability. Sneakers worn for the type of work I do take a beating, and these are extremely durable, and very comfortable on my feet all day. Size may run a smidge on the small side, but barely noticeable with my wide feet, so pretty true to size I would say. Length is good."
"I was nervous purchasing these shoes on the internet, however, my experience was excellent.  The size fit perfectly and I would recommend them to my friends.  These are excellent shoes for people who stand and walk in their job.  I would not recommend these for athletes or hard core fitness junkies...... no arch support.  If you want to save your aching feet after a long day of work, purchase this shoe.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that you cannot purchase the insole separately.  Sketchers will eventually get it right as it is superior to any walking shoe on the market.<br/><br/>Simply put....the insert outlasts the shoe under heavy use.  My last memory shoe purchase lasted 8 months...but well worth the investment."
"Very comfortable.  I walked about 60 miles on vacation and these shoes held up perfectly. With the memory foam, this is one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have owned. Excellent price on Amazon."
"I just got the shoes today and they look identical to the images. They fit almost perfectly. I was afraid they would be extremely wide, but they are just the right width. Once over worn them for a whole update this review in detail."
I walk a lot during the average day. These shoes run slightly bigger than others I have bought but not enough to go down 1/2 size. I've broken them in and fit is fine. Memory foam is really nice and provides great cushion.  Very stylish and appear to be very sturdy. Rubber 'belt' across upper toe is nice touch for ruggedness.  I've had them for a month and so far they look and feel great.
"I've got an unfortunate shoes size, 14 4E. Not the longest shoe ever but once you grow a foot that wide, your choices are rather limited and the color scheme even moreso (most things come in only black, white or taupe). Skechers are one of few companies that make this size in a number of styles and it fits perfectly, as expected. This was the first time I tried their memory foam shoes and they're better than expected. I can wear them all day without my feet hurting. I enjoyed them enough to buy a second pair a couple weeks later in a different color scheme. So, if you've got a big wide foot and want to try something comfortable that will feet, give this particular style a try."
"Great shoe! Like a lot of guys, when I find something I like I stick with it. This is like my sixth pair, I wear them everywhere and once they get worn &amp; dirty I use them for yard work and get another pair for ""dress""."
"Great show with a comfortable insole. After just a weeks worth of use they are still cushy comfy clouds of comfort to stand and walk in!<br/>My second pair as I liked the first pair so much I bought a,second in another color!"
"I really liked it.<br/>They are very comfortable.<br/>The color was the one I did not like much. But I will adapt.<br/>Comodo exceeds color.<br/>Sure, there were more colors.<br/>But I'll take these.<br/>Thank you"
These shoes are fantastic. They fit true to size.  They seem to be very rugged. The insoles feel like I am wearing slippers.  They are light weight which is also a plus.  I ordered three more pairs in different colors.
Bought these shoes with the promise of a wide toe box. They do not deliver! They are narrow and  small for a 4E width shoe. They also do not breathe! So they are both tight and warm because of the lack of ventilation.
"I always buy skechers boots, I work in construction and they are the only boots I have found that are comfortable enough to wear all day.<br/>So I looked at buying my first pair of sneakers, I have worn only rebook for the past 20 years. I can say these skechers are the most comfortable sneaker I have ever worn, I wear them 10+ hours a day in the summer months and my feet feel great. When I would get in from work with others the first think I would do is kick the shoes off. A few times now with these sneakers I forgot just walked in and didn't think to take them off till the wife yelled for walking around the house tracking dirt. My new brand!"
"I have extra wide feet. I have bought this several times before, I knew what I was getting; A good fitting comfortable shoe that has enough room for my foot and an insole pad. In my job, I walk over 17 miles a day. I need to have good shoes."
"I have had these shoes for... about 5 months. I wear them about 20 hours a week to work. The soles are literally peeling apart in chunks. I've never had an issue before with any other brand, and I usually wear the same shoes for a few years. The soles just wear out eventually. Not these. Crumbling to chunks in under 6 months of light use. I am not pleased."
"I own quite a few pairs of Skechers. They are very comfortable and wear well through the day. This pair, however, are pretty much the best of the bunch. The first day that I had them I had my day extend unexpectantly. I wound up wearing them for about 11 hours straight and my feet felt great at the end of the day. I highly recommend these, especially for days when you have to be on your feet alot"
I am a repeat buyer. Since back surgery I no longer run. But I walk a lot outside and inside and these feel comfortable and spongy. This is my third pair. I get about 6-9 months wear depending on the time of year.
"Highly impressed with these shoes. It took me months to commit to ordering them via internet as I am very wary of ordering products to wear online. Like to be able to try things on. These fit perfectly and very pleasantly surprised with the memory foam. Takes a little getting use to, but not in a bad way, just a something new and different way. The color and build is very high quality and should last many many years I imagine. Very excited about the blue color. I had a previous pair of sketchers from about 5 years ago that were a traditional hiking shoe greenish color. These are nice enough to wear out and about as well as a good hike. You should be very happy with this specific color and brand."
"I have been buying this sketchers with memory foam for a couple of years now. Very comfortable and light weight. At my job, I walk 10 to 15 miles per day and my feet don't get tire like they used too."
"My husband loves these shoes.  They are perfect for everyday wear, but they don't stand up real well.  He gets anywhere from 6 months to a year of hard ranch wear out of them.  He loves the memory foam insole."
"Bought for my husband who is very hard to fit (9 4E). He thought they were too narrow until his feet settled into the gel insole. Now he loves them. I have been with him 14 years and he has never had a tennis shoe fit ""good""."
Very comfortable and fit nicely. The only issue was a feeling of the toes falling in a valley at first but the padding in the center leveled off and now they feel normal. These look nice with a pair of jeans.
"this is the second pair I buy and my husband loves them.  I will buy a third, a forth, etc as long as they are available.  He is on his feet all day and really support and comfort his feet.  great cushioning."
I haven't been able to were closed toes shoes for more then an hour in years ( I live in Birkenstocks).  I was skeptical about how long I would be able to wear these but I can wear them for over 12 hours and still be comfortable.
"Bought these for my husband because he works on his feet all day, they were a little snug but that's to be expected with Sketchers. The major issue is the ""memory foam"" insoles start to fall apart after a couple of months. He said they were pretty comfortable. I give it two stars because the cost isn't worth having to replace them every couple of months. Buyer beware. If you don't mind them falling apart then go for it but not worth it. Which is a little disappointing because I have always bought Sketchers for myself and have had multiple pairs last many years. Too bad."
"I initially did not like these shoes because the memory foam, while it seemed like a good idea, it was too soft and did not provide sufficient support.  They also don't seem to breathe very well.  Therefore, I left these in the back of my closet while I continued to to prefer my nearly-identical Sketchers that don't have the memory foam.  That is until I injured my foot - I started wearing these again and the extra softness help to alleviate pain from the injury."
Very happy with the shoes. I would have gone with the brown version but for some reason they were $12 more. For the difference I went with black. Memory foam insole is quite comfortable. The sole seems well constructed even though the shoe is lightweight.
I spend a lot of time on my feet at work and these shoes are very comfortable. I have wide feet and most shoes that claim to be extra wide fit tight.  Not these shoes!  They fit great and my feet aren't tired at the end of the workday. Like them so much I bought a second pair.
"I have wide feet and high arches, so it usually takes a while for me to break in shoes. These fir amazingly well out of the box, and they're extra padded so it feels like waling on pillows almost. Definitely going to reorder when I wear this pair down!"
"These shoes are fantastic. I've worn them everyday for a week. That's when I first received them. I was a little skeptical at first after reading other reviews on Amazon. The only negative  on the reviews was these shoes wore out too fast.  For that, I don't know as I have only had them for a week. But oh what a week. These shoes are so comfortable that I didn't want to take them off after work. No kidding.  I got the pebel  and black color and they look great.  Like I said, I'll get back to you on whether or not they wear out fast. I honestly hope they don't because these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. I;m a real person and this is a real review. Because I read the reviews here on Amazon before I buy, I take it seriously.  So many of the reviews here on Amazon have helped me that I want to do likewise for others."
I previously bought a pair of these in a sporting goods store and after about a month one of the seams separated. I took them back and the store was out of stock so they refunded my money. I them brought these on Amazon (same size) bit they fit my feet much looser.  I don't understand why this would be. The new pair not near as comfortable as the others. Skechers quality seems inconsistent.
This is my husbands second pair of these and he loves them. He says they are comfortable and wear really well. The first pair lasted over two years. He loves these colors also because he says they go with anything.
"Had always purchased the Skechers Sport, but was unable to find them.  Purchased the Sport Memory Foam style and will give them a try.  Have worn them twice, so far OK.  Have always purchased size 9 D width, have always been happy with them."
"The shoe fits about a half size larger. The insole is lined with a slippery fabric that allows my foot to slide forward with every step. If you can get a perfect fit, if would be a comfortable shoe."
Comfy right out of the box! Fit as expected. Shipped very fast. Lets see how long these sneakers last. The foam insoles are glued in and hard to replace.
"I bought these for my husband ""Bigfoot"" he loves the memory foam, I bought him a different pair a couple of months ago also Sketchers Memory Foam and he raved about them so much, I decided there is nothing wrong with a man having a shoe wardrobe like a woman.  You definitely can't beat the price either for a size 14 WW + free shipping....Booyah!!  I remember the days of having to go to Nike Town at Lenox Mall in GA and paying $125-200 for shoes that are delivered to the showroom floor via a shoe elevator! I guess the money was spent on the fancy shoe elevator, love the evolution of technology but I really love Amazon, it is my favorite place to shop for everything!!"
"The day I got them in they were so comfortable that i wore them all day around the house like house shoes. I work on my feet for a majority of the day on concrete floors lifting heavy boxes and the like and my feet have never felt better. They are pretty lightweight but feel sturdy. I've read other reviews and it seems like the foam inserts that come with them never seem to last very long but you can always buy aftermarket ones to keep going. All in all very nice shoes that fit as i had hoped, will be buying a couple more pairs in different colors before they are discontinued or the price goes up.<br/><br/>*Update*<br/>8 Months later and the material is starting to come apart from the soul of the shoe, I was hoping for a bit more from this shoe. I suppose being on your feet all day in a warehouse really takes a toll on them. and the memory foam compacts after just a month or so, so plan on buying some insoles to go in them. Other than that they have been great shoes."
Very comfortable shoes and fit pretty much as expected.  A little slipping forward when I hike down hill or am being pulled by my dog in search of the latest squirrel or bird.  Probably need to be tied tighter to fix that issue.  Otherwise very good cushion which is great for me as I have arthritis in one hip.
Very good product and purchasing experience. 5 stars!
"The inside sole is attached ,Now what happens when this starts to break down?  This is my first pair soooo we'll see what happens? They seem alright a little tight but the shoe seems ok over all."
I love these sneaks... 2nd pair I've owned... the soles seem to be better glued as well. That was my only gripe last pair.. now with lots of work and play miles on them. they still sneak around
Fit great and very comfortable for my duck feet.
"These shoes are a little higher then what I expected with a 2"" heel, but they are very comfortable. I had an unexpected 10 mile walk and even though these shoes were only a week old, they held up very well on that walk. No break in necessary with these shoes they are comfortable as soon as you put them on, I will probably buy a second pair in another color for the price you can't go wrong."
"At first sight these are great,  looks like good construction and arch support but after about 3 weeks the backs had worn down so much,  they dug into my husband's Achilles until he bled..."
"Had it for one week, good shoes and great value for the price, I typically wear size 12, this shoes is a little bit large for its size, very comfortable with it during walking, let us see how well it will hold."
"I tend to strike on my midfoot and push off hard with my toes when I walk (I know more my issue than the shoes, but hey, my review here), so I'm very hard on the front part of shoes. The memory foam when new is comfortable, but after about three months of moderate use (not daily wear, a couple of medium length commute walks), I've worn a hole through the insole with my toes, and these shoes are now blister city. I'm disappointed because the soles appear like they would last, and the shoe despite being too wide is comfortable, but the memory foam durability is the weakest link for this shoe for me. As a result, I'm retiring mine far too soon."
"...except they fell apart in just over 4 months. Literally, the entire front portion of the sole simply separated from the shoe...I bought a second pair but decided to also go back to Asics as well."
"very comfortable.  Did not need to break in.  Used this past weekend walking around Hershey Park for 2 days.  My feet, ankles and knees did not hurt after 2 days of walking.  Highly recommend."
"Really love the design of the shoe and the comfortable memory foam. Takes some getting used to for the first couple of days after which the foam shape really helps with the fit. Been using it almost daily as my main pair of shoes to wear to college, for running, for biking or indeed anywhere and they have been really good all along except maybe for running where they may feel heavier than usual for some due to the large sole. But overall i love the product and the quality of Skechers. Having bought it for $40 this seems like a really good investment."
"I bought these boots for my husband and he absolutely loves them!!! He has extremely wide feet so it is very hard to find boots/shoes that he is comfortable in, but he wears these boots everyday even though i also bought him a pair of memory foam sketchers extra extra wide tennis shoes. He loves that the sole is actually rubber and not that hard plastic ""non-slip"" material. He has not complained about his lower back or knees hurting since he started wearing these and he is on his feet 12-14 hours a day! I would recommend buying these to anyone with wide feet that has problems finding shoes that fit properly! These are the only boots i will buy him from now on! I read the reviews and i was skeptical but so far so good."
Pros: I really like these shoes. They are comfortable and fit well.  It is to soon to say<br/>  how long they will last but for the price they are hard to beat.<br/><br/>Cons:  They are not the same shoes that are in the picture.  The shoes in the picture have a pull tab on the heel<br/>  which is one of the reasons I bought them because its easier to get the shoes on.  The top eyelet does not have the<br/>  red plastic eye protector.  They are plain like the other eyelets.  I exchanged the shoes noting the difference between<br/>  the two but I received the same shoes I returned.
"Really comfortable seem to be well built I will update if they end up not lasting but so far they are awesome!<br/><br/>!!!!UPDATE!!!!!<br/><br/>Been 4 months now, and the memory foam is wearing a way to the point where I replaced the insole, and the memory foam comfort effect didn't last long either. Also, I have never seen a shoe tear through as many socks as this one did. Almost all of my socks are in need of replacement. Also if you try to go for a nice walk in the woods and walk down hill be prepared to stop every 20 feet to reposition the insole as it moves around. The outside of the show however is holding up to the beatings I just wish I could say the same for the insides of the shoe."
Amazing shoes for my 15 yr old son. He wears a 10.5 and I ordered these a half size up (11) and they fit great with just enough room to grow into without the being too big right now.
"First I am no show expert by any means, I just see a shoe and if I like the way it looks I'll try it on, then if it feels good and comfy and the price isn't too high then I buy em.<br/>I can honestly say these are probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on my feet! The day they arrived I took off my other shoes and put these on right then I wore them the rest of the day, working in my shop a walking back and forth all over, my feet were not sore or tired at all. So far I really, really love these and as long as they last for me, I'd most definitely buy them again!"
These have reduced my foot pain significantly
"I really like these shoes. I work security so I'm on my feet a lot. I haven't had them long enough to comment on the wear, but so far so good. They are very comfortable and are easy on the feet.The memory foam also means I don't have to worry about finding an additional insole. It is holding up great so far. I actually have gotten a pair for walking/running outside and a pair for exercising inside the home to relieve some of the impact. That was by far the best thing I could've done. Also, even with my wide feet, I didn't have to get the 4E. A half size larger gave me more than enough room. I would almost venture that I could've gone spot on and be fine as well."
"My son has extremely wide feet and often complains about his shoes, but he loves these. They are comfortable for him. This is the third paid he's had, and wore the earlier two pairs until they were worn right out or got too small. Their only fault is that after wearing them for a while, the padding wears thin at the back of the heel, and there's a hard piece with a sharp edge that pokes through and rubs against his heel. We have dealt with it and covered it up because otherwise these are the only shoes I've found in years that get no complaints from him!"
Got this shoe and loved it. I wore it for just under 2 months before the bottom separated  from the rest of the shoe. I emailed Skechers about the problem and apparently they don't care because they have never responded to my email. Like I said I really liked the shoe but I should have been able to get more than 2 months of use out of it.
So far this shoe was very easy to ware.  No foot pain at all.  I have been wearing them for over a week. Plenty of toe room and no heel rubbing too. I just ordered a second pair.
I love the shoes and I'm not returning them BUT they are snug (maybe I have fat feet).  The color was not exactly as advertised but also not bad.  I like the memory foam a whole lot.  I will actively look for shoes with memory foam from here on out.
"I'm a 5'5"", 125# female who normally wears a size 8 women's shoes.  I decided to order the men's size because after trying on the women's size at the local department store, I didn't care about the fit.  I figured go with the men's size.  I ended up returning these for a refund on the product only.  I didn't wear these out of the house, just inside on carpet, so I'm not able to judge how long I was able to wear these comfortably.  Even with a men's size, it still fit a little tight and it could be the way the top of my foot arches up.  The memory foam definitely helped with the cushion feel, however the width was still somewhat narrow and tight.  This just wasn't for my feet but it doesn't mean it isn't for yours."
"This is the second pair I have ordered, the first pair I wore them almost every day for a year and a half. Really held up well in the mud and snow and held up well in really bad conditions"
"The best sports shoes I have ever have, I'm using them for work and I'm considering to purchase a second pair. Si incredibly comfortable, I am a RN and work 12 hours shift at a hospital setting and these pair are heaven to my feet. 100% recommended for long hours working people"
"These shoes are just short of a miracle. My husband is a veteran who now enjoys walking to work. After a long 8 hour shift on his feet plus his walks he comes home complaining of his knee, ankle, and hip hurting. Of course he is stubborn so I can't get him to take anything or use anything special to alleviate his pain. I searched long and hard to find a comfortable pair of shoes for him that were not outrageously expensive. It has been over a week of use and I have not heard a single complaint of hurting joints."
"Only problem is the memory foam wears out.Mine lasted seven months in these shoes then it's uncomfortable to wear them.This has happened with every memory foam shoe I've had an I think these lasted the longest.Problem is it's hard if not impossible to pull memory foam out and add an insert , but if you don't pull it out shoes is to tight.Plus a good insert cost 20 bucks an another pair of shoes is only 37 right now.Ill probably buy another pair cause other than foam wearing out they have up under a lot of use."
"Super comfortable right out of the box. I wear a size 11 D. Originally ordered a Wolverine hiking shoe that I had to return as they were a half size too small.  I ordered these Skechers  as replacements. Size wise they actually feel a little big on my feet, but not enough to be annoying.  The memory foam insoles feel great on your feet. Received these shoes on Friday and wore them all day Saturday and Sunday working a flea market and my feet felt great at the end of the day.  I will defiantly be buying Skechers again."
"I bought these for my husband several months ago and they are GREAT!  He spends most of the day on his feet and often experiences pain due to unusually high arches.  On average, he needs a new pair every few months because of how hard he is on work shoes.  These are very durable and comfortable.  They are showing no signs of falling apart of losing their memory foam support."
I wear these for walking. I have walked up to 4 miles a few time in them and they have remained comfortable. Pricing was much better here than at local store. The sole pad has slid down a little in the shoe but I just pulled them back into place. Overall very satisfied
"I have custom orthotics that I transfer from shoe to shoe, due to diabetic complications. I really liked the look of this shoe, but was concerned that the interior wasn't removable.<br/><br/>No need to worry. The memory foam hold my feet great, with no pain, even after wearing them several hours. I will say that if your not used to a memory foam shoe, you may experience a 'getting used to it' couple of days, where your feet will be sore when you take them off. This is pretty much normal when you do something new.<br/><br/>The shoes needed no breaking in, &amp; after adding a pair of Lock Laces, these have been my everyday wear shoe since I got them."
didnt realize these where memory foam. the memory foam simply goes flat and offers no support.  the shell of the shoe does not hold up to moisture at all.  i expect these to last with occasional use for about 4 months.
"Skechers seems to me the exact same quality as Nike and other brands higher priced for their name. This is my third pair of Skechers because they always fit, priced fairly and last."
Great shoes!<br/>They prevent my back and legs from getting so fatigued and aching after being on my feet for eight to ten hours at work as a Wal-Mart Cashier.<br/>I'm 70 years young and needed the support.
"Definitely needs a little breaking in when you get it. Bit stiff in flexibility and with the memory foam out of the box. Your feet might hurt for the first 2 days of use while the foam softens. But after 3-4 days of all-day wear and walking, it now feels like I'm walking on pillows contoured just for my big feet. One of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I keep reading from people complaining about the rapid wear down happening within 3 months of use. I'll update this review once I pass the 3 month mark!"
I have been using same brand and size and I am extremely happy with it but somehow this one is rather loose. I have its pictures and label which says<br/>SN 51208 EW Color Code NVGY. I hope Skecher can get me the size that I am using for more than a year
Order one size larger and they will be perfect
These shoes are very comfortable and substantial.  Too many athletic shoes today are just thin pieces of crap.  These are well made and have a thicker sole and the gel pads.
"I like these shoes, although the memory foam insoles take a little getting used to.  Also, because of the memory foam, I feel these shoes wear a little big. I tried this size on in a local store and they felt great.  After a week of wearing these daily though, the memory foam has compressed ever so slightly making it difficult to get a snug fit with the laces.<br/><br/>Also, they feel wider than previous wide models of Sketchers I have owned."
These shoes fit well and are very comfortable.  The only issue I have with them is that they use canvas cloth loops instead of metal or plastic eyelets for the shoestrings.  This provides high friction for the shoe strings and one can not merely pull on the top laces to tighten the shoes.  You have to start at the bottom and work your way up loop by loop to tighten the strings.  And of course to take the shoe off you have to reverse the process.  It just means that you need an extra minute or two to put your shoes on.
Bought these for a vacation for my husband as he did not have decent walking shoes.  He was kind of hesitant thinking new shoes and long walking times..  He had no complaints and they didn't hurt his feet at all.
"My husband loves this sneaker. What a relief as he is the most difficult guy when it comes to buying shoes. According to him, they never fit right. These sneakers look very nice right of the box. The insole is memory foam, so they are very comfy."
Will live with them.  Just a bit too big.  I have had 4E size Sketchers before and they were fine.  Maybe it was the model.  I don't know.  Nice looking shoe though.
"Perfect fit.  I have very wide feet, and these come it very wide!  Now I don't have to wear boats to get the width I need.  The memory foam is very comfortable too."
"Fit is good!  Nice shoe, comfortable and nicely made.  Just the right amount of flexibility (I hate ""stiff"" sneakers).  I would definitely buy them again."
Got these for my husband and he is rough on shoes he had these about 3 months before they started messing up some and after 6 months they were trash but for him that's about average time.
Nice shoes for the price. Got them for work I walk a lot. Had to put insoles in them cause my feet always hurt no matter what kinda shoe it is I walk miles upon miles
"Felt good the moment I wore them.  Hardly any breaking in period, although after wearing them two more times it feels like I've had them for a couple of months."
"Amazon description indicated memory foam insert came out. Nope... must've been an old version though that's what I wanted, removable, because I have orthotics."
"Ordered size 8 at first, since that usually works. It was a bit tight over the toes, so I ordered size 8.5. These were good in the toes, but a bit<br/>large at the heel. So, after trying them on (both pairs ) many times, I found the smaller size was spreading out a bit, and they were comfortable<br/>when I had bare feet. The 8.5 size are perfect when I use sport socks. So, I decided to keep both pairs: the size 8 for the summer and the larger size for the cooler weather or when doing sports with socks on."
"Nice shoes! I bought them as a gift for my autistic brother, he stands on his tip toes. He cant put his feet down, so I needed shoes with a good bottom. The memory foam is very relaxing on his feet."
"My husband loves this style of Skecher's shoe's but we can never find his size, so we were grateful to find them here on Amazon!! The shoe's were a perfect fit too!!"
"Great product, this shoe is light, very comfy and has great support. BUT they are TOO LARGE FOR ME. I am a size 13 in 95% of my shoes. This size 13 were bigger than most. I returned these and bought the 12's which fit perfectly."
"Skechers sneakers always seem to run slightly small. The memory foam is comfortable, but warm.  It might be nice in the winter, but doesn't breath much when it is hot.  The shoes are light and very comfortable."
I got these for my husband and he loves them! He has been walking miles every day for weight loss and his feet were killing him. I got him these and he immediately put them on and put them to the test to great results.
"Aside from them making my feet look bulky (I don't know why, might just be me) these are my favorite shoes. The memory foam insole make it easy o wear them all day. First wearing was for several hours and few miles walking, no blisters or sore spots. These shoes feel better than my previous favorite pair that I had to break in for years."
Received it today and it fits perfect and very comfortable. Looks great! I definitely recommend this. I give it five stars!
"Very nice shoe, but seemed a bit too small. I had to order the next half size up and they fit perfectly. The return for the ones that did not fit was super easy!"
"These are the same shoes that I bought the last time because they lasted 8 months which is a record for me.  I wear my shoes and walk in them approximately 13.5 hours a day 3 to 4 days a week.  I though I ordered the normal width however wide width showed up, they seem to fit just fine though."
"Nice product, quick shipping, and at a better price and better condition that the ones I nearly bought at a retail store."
"Sketchers are always a perfect fit.  I've been buying these for my husband for years.  He likes the memory foam... and since they are very reasonably priced, we can buy new as needed when memory foam and/or soles wear out (FYI - my husband wears them every day to work, and he has to walk a lot at his job)."
"As a mailman for almost 30 years i know good footwear and need it. Normally most of the year i wear sport shoes and normally new balance wides and they are ok comfort level and decent wear. As for these shoes however I can say they are even more comfortable than any new balance i've had and very cushiony.  I've wore these now a few months now and i'm glad i bought these and i will buy another pair for next year.<br/>As with the other reviews they do run large, i would suggest to get a half size smaller than what you normally wear. they are also plenty of room in the toe area, also they have worn about the same durability wear as the new balance for me in the quality control.  hope this helps you."
"Showed up in its retail box, brand new, and fit exactly like they are supposed to. I love these shoes, it's the 4th pair I've bought. The memory foam is comfy and the shoes are incredibly sturdy"
"Great quality shoe, love the comfort and memory foam and I work on concrete floor. So awesome product and great price and turn around time from amazon"
"Love the memory foam Skechers shoes.  I use these at work until they get worn, then use either in the garage or for mowing until they are destroyed."
what i like most about this shoe is that it fits perfectly...it also feels good on my feet when i'm doing a lot of walking...price is also resonable
Even though these are men's shoes and I am a woman the memory foam in them sure helps my feet  so they don't get so sore. I have now ruined the ones I just bought so I will be buying the exact same pair again they were just that good
"Great shoe, fits and feels well on my foot.  First time I have a memory foam in my shoe and it is wonderful.  Would recommend this shoe to anyone."
"Pretty nice shoes.  My son loved them, Not sure how they hold up since my sons girlfriend didn't like them so he wasn't allowed to wear them much."
"I normally wear 11-11.5 and these size 11 are slightly big for me. There an ok shoe. Not great,but not bad. I just wanted a black shoe for work. These do  the trick."
The sole is showing a bit of wear after only two months... And it's quite flat now. But they're still comfortable. Just not as comfortable as it was the first few weeks.<br/><br/>9 MONTHS UPDATE: The soles are disintegrating and are very uncomfortable now. They were also defeated by a small stick which stabbed through the bottom of the shoe and into my foot (ouch). I didn't subject these to a lot of hard use. I've never had a pair of shoes fall apart so quickly.
got these for my husband for work ... hoping they will look cleaner since his last pair had white details .... he loves sketchers and memory foam
"this is the nth pair I buy and keep fitting perfectly. I wear 11.5 wide on most brands and fit as a glove. I don't remember the sole being so slippery on wet floor though, so that's why four stars."
Skechers Memory Foam says it all! Very well made shoe with a great insole. My absolute favorite for general use but especially for hour-long walks on the treadmill. Perfect fit and durable construction.
These are for my son and he has worn this same shoe for work for a couple of years.  They wear well and stand up to a daily beating on his job.
This is a nice shoe. It's wide and comfortable. Good for work. After foam is gone just add the right insole for you.They last long. Great quality show.
"Husband said one shoe is tighter than the other side, but otherwise he likes them. He expects them to only last 1 year, as that's how they make things nowadays."
Love the fit and very comfortable. These are my sixth pair of skeckies. Great price and fast delivery. Cant go wrong if you know your size.
The memory foam that it comes with is great and seems to really have stopped almost all of my foot pain.  It would totally be a 5 if it was not for the fact it seems to be a bit of a long shoe.  The size is just a bit off.  12 4 E is normally perfect for my foot but these noticeably have a bit of slip as if its too long...may also be a side effect of the memory foam insert playing tricks on my mind as it seems like my foot is slipping but may not be.  But great shoe for sure.
"Update:  The shoes were great but I tend to overpronate and these shoes wore out in 3 months. With most shoes I can get 6 to 8 months.<br/><br/>Original: These shoes are very comfortable.  I've only had them a few weeks so can't speak to how they will hold up.  However, I've had good experience with Skecher shoes.<br/>The only issue I have is that they are a little wider than my other size 11 shoes.  The 2"" heel also helps during the rain and also makes me seem a bit taller. :O)"
"When you find that perfect shoe...it's my opinion to by several...tuck away in the closet...and hope they don't discontinue.  This is the perfect shoe for my husband, bad back, many hours on his feet and, working tirelessly,  so to find something that provides such comfort is a blessing.  To find these shoes in so many colors and his size was another blessing.  I ORDERED 4 pair!!!  Tucked neatly away :)  great price,  fast shipping, complete, NO ERRORS."
"I've been wearing this model of Sketchers for years now, and this is my go-to shoe.  It's model is one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned, and comes in WIDE!  My only query is...why the Memory Foam?  Eventually with that much compression, the insulation will become no thicker than a paper towel over time.  I'd recommend making the lining thicker, since the heel area in all my shoes always rubs the most and wears thin, but this is another personal gripe.  Still 5 stars, an excellent shoe."
Does not stay on your feet....not because of bad fit but because the heel section is too low and feels like you're wearing flip flops...
"These sneakers fit perfectly.  I have a hard time finding shoes that are wide enough, even when advertised as wide.  The memory foam is amazing and support very well."
My husband loves these shoes and wears them whenever he's not working.  Got a better deal on Amazon than in the Sketchers outlet store.
Good shoes comfortable use them for hard work. I get 6 months out of them. More than the Sketchers work force I used before. Their  work sneakers are junk compared to these.
"I bought these for my husband who is quite pleased with the fit, the appearance, as well as the price!<br/>Well made with excellent support."
Would love to give them a 5 star but they are just too darn ugly.  The fit great and are comfortable. Wish they looked a bit better!
"These are nice - in between sneakers. Good for a walk, pass on some job sites as hiking boot look without being too casual looking."
Got 2 pairs for my husband as replacements for his last 2 pairs of these! He likes them and they come in a 5E so the width is very important.
"Bought these for my husband, he wasn't sure about them but after wearing them the first day, he was hooked!  Said they are very cushioned and comfortable.  He had worn sketchers for years, then got away from them due to wear and tear.  We'll see how long these last, but so far they are awesome!  (And look great too!)<br/><br/>June 26, 2015 - update:  wear and tear.  My husband loves these shoes and has worn them constantly.  Unfortunately, you can tell.  The insides are worn out already, one toe is pulling away and soles are showing some wear already.  I told him I thought I'd bought them before Christmas, and when we looked it up and saw he's only had them since April, I was very disappointed.  Nothing seems to be made to last anymore."
"For the money there is no way you can beat these shoes. Great fit, super high quality and exceptionally comfortable. I love them!"
"I had a tib/fib fracture to my left leg along with my ankle shattered. I now have a rod and several pins in my leg. Amazingly, I have recovered well over the years but find myself needing better support in sneakers and this can be tough to find. Feel's like a well built sneaker, tough and the support is so much better than Nike brands that I have. Definitely would recommend. I always work outdoors all day and find this to be a good sneaker for all weather types."
"ive only worn these shoes one time so far for work, but im very happy with them. the memory foam feels pretty good, and when they give way. ill probably just rip them out and put normal soles in them. i wear a size 14 and they fit perfectly, not too snug. overall very happy with this purchase."
"Don't buy these. After a couple of months my pair developed a painful problem. There is a piece of metal or something hard on the inside of the heel on both shoes that started sticking out into the back of my foot. It was not possible to wear the shoes after that. Waste of money. If you are reading this at customer service please try to fix the problem for future customers, and you ought to refund me."
"I used these for a high impact, 12 hours on your feet job. I loved them and they held up longer then most the other shoes I tried while working on a route."
These shoes only last me about two months until I had to start using scissors to cut off pieces of the sole as it started coming apart and now less than four months later they've become so worn down that it's time to buy a different pair of gym shoes. As a personal trainer who works six days a week I do get a lot of use out of my gym shoes but the standard amount of time each pair lasts me is about 6 months whereas with less than 4 these were significantly below that standard. I like the design and the feel was very nice at first just not durable enough for what I need.
"Very comfortable work sneakers, great on being on concrete all day"
I have been wearing Skechers for decades.  I know my size.  WIDE!  Hard for me to find in Wyoming.  Used to gets them when we went to SLC.  Get what I want and fit delivered to my door.
Too large and slipped off my heel. Ordered a size 10 and this show was also uncomfortable in addition to being too large. Returned for refund.
"I really like these shoes.  Very comfortable in most everyday situations, and seem to be durable (my everyday shoe, including work).  They fit as expected."
I got these shoes for my husband.  He's on his feet all night at work and has worn them for a few weeks now.  He takes these things to work and still says they are awesome to wear.  His feet don't hurt as much and they give great support - and beyond that the shoes feel like they did the first time he tried them on!
"Tight in the toes so I will order EE next time...Nice shoes otherwise..The 2.0 Arlor Oxford, Black, 11M had more room in the toe area!"
super comfortable. possibly the most comfortable shoe i have ever owned. i walk alot in a very rocky area and never have an issue they do runa little big though
"Very comfortable fits great , I work and walk a lot very good soles and pattern for foot comfortable.. would buy them again"
"Yeah after buying them, i didnt wear them for a few months, now i tired wearing them, they run small.. good shoes just cant return them.. owell i will find a homeless guy that can.."
Foam did not last. This is the second pair. I thought the first going bad was just an anomaly and bought a second with hopes they would last longer than the first. No such luck. Won't be buying or recommending these again.
"So supportive and well designed you'll want to wear them every day all day<br/>  To bad I cant polish them to wear to the office, 😁"
I ordered the same size as my husband's New Balance shoes and these are about a half inch too short. I had to return them.
Most comfortable sneakers. I wore them all weekend long. I have always loved skechers especially when they fit my size 15 feet.<br/>The memory foam is amazing. I never thought I could find a more comfortable sneaker. The thick sole takes some getting used to. It adds about 2 in on to your height. I will definitely purchase another pair. Much cheaper here on Amazon than on skechers website or even the big and tall store I  shop at.
These are like a pair I have been wearing for two years and I really like them.They fit perfectly and the come in wide widths which I need because of flat feet. Very supportive and comfortable because of the memory form innersole.
Got my shows in 1 day and they feel great on my feet. I don't see how you can beat these for the price (less than $55 and $11 of that was one day shipping). I have worn them all day and I think they are the most comfortable walking shows I have ever owned. I really like the look of this show too in the charcoal color. If they hold up well over the next six months then I will order them again.
These shoes have been fantastic. Bought them in the summer and it became immediately obvious just how long it had been since I had a nice comfortable pair of tennis shoes like these. The inserts have been so soft and comfy it's like walking on soft carpet all day! Seems like a sturdy build and they have held up well so far (and I've been out on a few hikes with them). I'd buy another pair of this same shoe if they are still available when these wear out!
These were for my husband and they are high quality and are really nice looking!! Perfect fit! I highly recommend these!! They are also still black and look new!
Love these shoes. I buy the same model/size and they work great for me. I like to walk a lot and go through a few pairs a year.
Excellent shoe for my husband's high arch wide feet. He is delighted with the fit and feel of these shoes.  Great find!
"I normally purchase New Balance, but these looked good at a similar price so I took a chance. The fit is very similar to NB. Soles are grippy and the memory foam inserts are comfortable (good cushion and they don't get too hot). I've only had them a month, but if they hold up for six, I'll consider them again in the future."
"These shoes were 'stiffer' than other Skechers I have purchased in the past.  The fit was as expected as I've got wide feet, but this pair was not as flexible as other athletic shoes .  I would hope that over time, the shoes will 'give' a little more as I break them in!"
"Excellent value, comfortable from the first time worn. I am on my feet for 12 hours a day and so far no foot fatigue. Typical great shoe from Sketcher, my second pair."
"These are good shoes, but nothing special.  The comfort  level is OK, but well short of what I want in a walking shoe.  This is my third pair of Skechers, and the least comfortable of the three.<br/><br/>They had a strong odor of glue when received. It took a week of wear for that to go away.<br/><br/>According to the description these have a ""Removable memory foam insole"".  The insole is not removable so I deducted one star for false advertising."
"I've been buying these shoes for awhile and like them better than anything else i've tried. These are the fourth pair I've bought and I am totally satisfied with them. I try to keep two pairs in my closet, exchanging them until one pair is no longer servicable. I will buy another pair and discard to older ones."
"These shoes are great!  I ordered my normal size, and the fit matched my other casual and dress shoes, exactly.  As others have said, these shoes are very comfortable. I walk a lot, and these shoes with the thick patterned soles and insoles put a bounce in one's step. They look good, are well made and breathe. The first time you put them on they're a bit snug, but once the insole conforms to your foot, they are cushy and very comfortable.  I have had no problems with durability, and do not foresee any in the future."
"Real soft soles but the 1½ "" cactus thorns on my desert property still penetrate the soles and stab my feet!  Otherwise real comfortable."
the price is great and I was able to get two for my hubby that loves to have one for work and to go out ! perfect !~
These are great fitting shoes.  I have an extra wide size 13.  The us 13 E4 is a perfect fit.  Shoe looks well made.
"I love these shoes.  But the cushion pad in the inner sole is coming out/getting holes(see pic).  I am going to contact Sketchers and see if they will replace the pads cause it feels like little pebbles when I walk.  I have only had these shoes a couple months. They were narrow AT FIRST, and I almost returned them for the Wide size 11,  but after a few days they broke in.  Fit great now!  I hope they last a long time.  I have always had good luck with Sketcher. I wear these about 4-5 hours a day. Good rubber sole/traction.  Don't show dirt,  which is nice since I go to a dog park every day."
"This is the second pair of these shoes that I purchased.  The sole started comming apart from the shoe after 3-4 months.  Threw the first pair away and bought this pair.  Same thing.  after 3 or 4 months of wearing a couple of days per week the sole starts coming unglued.  I keep gluing back together with hot blue but ultimately the entire sole falls off.  They are very comfortable, but, I will not be buying another pair."
OMG the shoes are amazing! And the price is also amazing! It's like walking on a cloud! I definitely recommend these!
My husband has a very large and wide foot. These are comfortable!
"These are good for wide feet (purchased the wide ones). They don't hold up too long, but still very comfortable."
"My Senior Citizen husband ordered these shoes for walking and exercising. He had purchased this shoe each year. Then he keeps the precious year's shoes for yard work.<br/><br/>We walk 5 miles per trek. Considering for the days when it's too hot or too cold to go out walking, it's safe to say these shoes get 400 miles per year.<br/><br/>He says it's a comfortable shoe, that he orders 1 width wider for comfort during exercise. Very good cushioning."
"So far so good, bought for walking and the very first walk I feared the blisters and sore feet. However the shoes were quite comfortable right out of the box had absolutely no issues, would recommend."
"Wasn't expecting the extremely soft cushions built-in, which make walking a pleasure.<br/><br/>Ben<br/>TemporalWars.com"
"these shoes are made to walk on grass I'm guessing, since they pretty much get destroyed if you walk on a side walk"
Very comfortable and will be using them for treadmill workouts told my sister about them she will be getting a pair.
"Fit nice, lace easily but very loud on tile floors ( sounds like I am wearing cleats ) even so great traction"
Extra wide and memory foam?  So why did they hurt to wear the first day..... getting better with each day...
"Very comfortable, good quality. Great fit.. can't go wrong with skechers, only shoes I will buy. Recommended!"
Perfect. I prefer these lace-ups over the slip-on models as they feel more secure and adjustable. Great shoe
My third pair of sketchers. My third pair that's coming apart. Less than 3 months old and falling to pieces.
"The Skechers Afterburn are very comfortable with its memory foam insoles. The style is what I like most about it with it's rugged but sporty looks. I volunteer as a range safety officer and I'm on my feet all day so these shoes are perfect for outdoor range duty and other outdoor activities. The shoes have that "" broken in"" feel to them which adds to the comfort fit right out of the box. If you're on the fence about getting a pair of Skechers Afterburn, you won't regret buying them."
"My second pair of these, for someone with bad feet these are very comfortable, thanks to the memory foam. Cheaper here than at the store."
My guy has wide feet and the Skechers are a great price and with wide width options they are perfect! We have bought before and will buy again.
"The only brand I will buy, a very comfortable fit and with Amazon's prices it makes for make a sweet deal."
I've been a skechers fan for years and these shoes didn't let me down.  Really like the memory foam sole..
Husband loved his birthday sneakers!  Perfect fit and looking good.  Would order again! No more works left.  Will no longer review if there is a minimum number of words.
One of the few shoes I find comfortable. Great price compared to shoe store. only problem is the glue on the soles comes loose after 6 -9 months.
Excellent buy.  So comfortable.
"More than I expected. Have been wearing New Balance for work, decided to try these. We'll see in due time."
"My husband has a really hard time with his feet and ALWAYS wore the same shoes. I finally got him to try something else and it happened to be the Sketcher's afterburn memory foam shoe. He couldn't believe how they felt. He bought them and just loves them. However he had them since February and the memory foam is wore away. I think they should last a bit longer in my opinion. (hence the four stars) But, he likes them so much he had me order him another pair. Hopefully this new pair wears better"
"Sketchers are my favorite! My husband and son destroy clothing and shoes on campouts and just regular activity. I know that these will last them. My husband loved the wide fit. He said he felt like he was walking in platform shoes at first, but likes the memory foam. I should have nabbed a pair for my son!"
"My son, who is a civil engineering students does a lot of walking between job sites and campus. This is now his number one shoe which has replaced on old pair of Sketchers purchased in Las Vegas four years ago.  These are the two shoes he literally lives in while on campus.<br/>It is certainly being put to good use."
This is the second time we have ordered this show.  Very comfortable and durable.  Very happy customer!
"The soles of these shoes were incredibly rigid, and the uppers of the shoe were firm enough to cause a blister at my ankles if I had kept these for my planned walking activities."
I am on my fourth pair of these.  I have a high instep and wide ball of the foot.  These adapt well and fit okay.  They are comfortable and I have been happy with how long they survive.
My husband has an injured foot. These Sketchers are so comfortable for him - and they look great! Jet Black
These shoes fit perfectly and feels good on my feet when walking. Will order another pair In a different color.
"My husband has been raving about these shoes for the past two weeks.  He works at a hotel, and is on his feet alot.  He says that his feet no longer hurt or get hot &amp; smelly.  He has more energy at the end of the day.  They are the best shoes he's ever worn.  The hotel's Executive Chef saw his shoes and asked if they were Skechers with memory foam.  He said that he has a dressier version and absolutely loves them!  He bought two pairs.  I think that I'd better buy a second pair!"
"Memory Foam shoes are awesome, but for some reason this one seems to cause pain on the ball of my feet when walking all day. I would use this shoe as my daily driver if it weren't for that fact. I'd recommend more padding/support on the ball of the foot."
Great fit very comfortable. Look nice and able to wear to work when needed. Sole forms to foot and feels like it was made just for you.
"Starting with four stars to see if the soles tear up like everyone says. I have big feet and normally wear 14 eeee. This is what i ordered on these shoes but the slip. I'm a delivery driver and walk up and down a ramp all day long and i have to make sure they are tied pretty tight so they don't slip on my feet. They seem to run a but big, which is weird because I normally buy sketchers and at this size. Otherwise they are very comfortabole and i have bad feet I do recommend them."
"I have wide feet that make it difficult for me to find sneakers, skates, dress shoes or any other footwear. I was reluctant to give up my 3 year old New Balance kicks that I used primarily for the gym but they were shot and 18 months overdue for replacement. I went to Dick's Sporting Good and they had one pair that fit but they cost $139 and I'm not paying that much money for gym shoes.<br/><br/>So I turned to Amazon and used their well oiled search engine criteria to locate all the 4E shoes they had. My wish list was simple - wide enough to be comfortable out of the box, &lt; $75, a dark color that won't look dirty in 6 months and 4+ star users ratings by more than 100 users. The locus of those criteria was these shoes. I've always liked Skechers casual shoes and figured I'd give these a try. These shoes came in at just over $40, almost $100 less than Dicks and I think it took less time for the Skechers to show up with Prime than it did for me to find the 17 year old kid working in Dick's shoe department. No wonder big box stores are dying - their customer service and sales staffs stink<br/><br/>Pro<br/>- Wide enough to fit perfectly. These shoes do not run big and I might have expected a 4E to be just a but wider than I needed but they were ideal<br/>-  Comfortable - wore them all day for two days with no issues, blisters, hot spots or discomfort<br/>- Solidly made sole that will hold up to elliptical, stationary bikes and treadmills<br/>- Decent style, like the dark colors<br/>- The laces are the right length. That might sound like nitpicking but my old New Balance shoes had laces that were two inches too long on each end and they kept getting untied and dragging on the ground which not ideal in the men's room.<br/>- $100 less than comparable shoes at Dick's<br/><br/>Con<br/>- There seemed to be a hard spot under the ball of each foot when I first put them on that dissipated in a few hours. It didn't hurt, it was just hard. It worked itself out in the first day,<br/><br/>These are solid casual, gym use shoes. They are too heavy for actual running but for machine use indoors where the extra weight adds to the workout. If you need superlight runners, be prepared to shell out north of a C- note. Hope that helps! Tretiak"
"This sneaker are realy good. Fit perfect, light, and comfortable to wear. I would suggest this shoes to people who walk a lot."
The sides of the shoe are too loose and gives no support. It makes my feet hurt; however the toe has room and is not restrictive.
"I've been wearing Skechers for several years &amp; I love them!!! The price was so much better than shoe store!!! Great shoes, comfortable!!!"
"Love the shoes although they were a bit large for the size compared to my asics, I ordered 14 4w as I do with my other brand and I should have ordered 13 4w. I decided rather than send them back and exchange them for 13 4e I would donate them to a American Vet. and re-order the 13 4w for my self. They are one of the most comfortable shoes I have had on in a long time, wish they had more colors but I have sketchers on my ""top of the Line"" list."
"Difficult to find wide shoes that fit right.  This 4E fit as expected. Shoe looks look, and feel great."
Good shoes. I have a pair to do yard work &amp; a pair for non dressy everyday.  Worn by a 63 yr. old man with a little extra weight.
"I did not know hiking shoes could feel so nice. Fit is amazing, no pressure points. SOFT insert."
these are solid sneakers the bottoms are hard and give your feet alot of support - my second pair
"Although I haven't owned them long, they​ are very comfy. Once tightened properly, they fit as expected. The memory foam adds extra comfort. For the price, they are definitely worth it."
Comfortable! Well made. My favorite shoe to wear. Fells like your floating on air. Highly recommended for every day use
"Great shoes so far but we'll see if the memory foam lasts.  I was somewhat leery of ordering shoes from Amazon online, but decided to take a chance since I could get my exact shoe size which is men's wide 10.5.  I wouldn't run or exercise in these shoes since they feel like they have a bit too much give.  But for walking around and basic activity, I find they fit my needs perfectly.  It was a good price, they seem like great quality shoes, and it seems they are accurate in their shoe sizing.<br/><br/>I'll update my review if I ""run"" into any issues later on as I continue using these shoes."
I have other Skechers love these shoes wear a size 10 and they always fit perfect will by again
Got these for hubby who stands a lot.  He loves them and says they are so comfortable.  Would buy them again.
"As someone who normally wears 17 Double-Wide shoes, finding these Sketchers was a miracle for me! My size in Sketchers is very different from Nike or ASICS, but these are amazingly comfortable and have held up much better than the newer ASICS.<br/><br/>I have ordered the pair I am wearing and two additional pairs are sitting in the closet for when these ones wear out.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend these enough."
Fits well and also feels great worth every penny fast shipping and everything can't go wrong
"These are very comfortable with excellent support. I'm always skeptical with anything claiming ""memory foam"" but these are done right. They give the right amount of bounce that make them great for concrete jungle jogging or mall walking. I got mine in 4E wide and they are very roomy and comfortable. The Amazon deal made them cheaper here than at my local Sketchers outlet store - where they rarely carry 4E wide."
I purchased this for my boyfriend and this is what he has to say......I have wore these shoes for eight hours on average....They are nice and somewhat comfortable but not as comfortable as a previous pair of skechers that I have purchased and loved...The previous pair when you wore them it felt like you was walking on sunshine all day long you could ware them all day and night if you wanted too....This pair of Skechers Sport Men's Afterburn Memory Foam Lace-Up... feel ok but not as good as my old ones...but still a nice shoe....I am not exactly sure what they changed in the memory foam from the old to the new ones...but they dont feel like they are made as well as the previous pair I had...It doesn't have the same walking on sunshine feeling....I would recommend this shoe for a casual wearing shoe not an all day aggressive and well used shoe ..like on your feet all day on concrete or on your feet standing all day job...I hope you find this information useful in making a purchasing decision.. Thank You for reading this review and your time and have a wonderful day.
"Comfortable shoes these are my second pair to buy for my husband, he said the shoe strings are a little long."
I got an 11 3E shoe as ordered and it is very comfortable.  The construction is solid. I have some neuropathy in one foot and these shoes are still a good fit.
"This is a good brand, well constructed and I like the colors available. I have two pairs took them on a Europe trip, and did a lot of walking they were good but there was a bit of a break in period they feel a bit more comfortable after that, but rubbed a bit hard on my little toe at first."
It's been the only shoe I've worn for the past 3 years. They last a lot longer than others I've tried.
"I have size 12 1/2 feet so I have to buy size 13 shoes, in most cases. Therefore, these shoes are slightly large for me. I've had these shoes for almost 2 weeks and I am getting used to the size factor, no blisters so far. Overall these are the most comfortable shoes that I've ever worn. I stand and walk at work all day long and the memory foam really helps the discomfort and pain factor."
"It's hard enough finding comfortable sneakers for a size 15 foot, but the width can sometimes be harder. My grandson Loves these and yes they are wide enough. 2 thumbs Up!"
"My son absolutely loved these shoes. He kept saying that they were the most comfortable shoes he own. He has wide feet and they fit well. The problem is, and I am so sad it happened, he sprayed water proofer on them and they had a loose string on them. He used a lighter to burn the string off and the the entire shoe went up in flames. He burnt his eyebrows and was able to get the shoe into the kitchen sink. When I get more money I will order the exact pair but no water proofing this time. What a bizarre thing to happen. Thanks for a great shoe that is now burned up."
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"These shoes ultimately lasted a long time, but after just 6 nights of use on the hospital floor, they were killing my heels. I got over a year's worth of service out of them with gel-type inserts - double stacked! The shoes are relatively heavy! The inner sidewall lining over the plastic heel cups is super cheap and wore away, causing ultimate failure when the heel cup edges started cutting into my socks."
"I bought a 10.5 and should have got an 11. These are nice shoes but go big. They also make a lot of noise on the hardwood and linoleum in my apartment. I don't like the memory foam either.<br/><br/>If you like memory foam and buy a half size big, you may like these shoes. They do look good."
My Hubby loves these shoes. Too bad they don't last more than a couple of months 😒 the stitching at the bend of the shoe it the first thing to go and then the toes open up. I wish he could find a similar shoe. He's on his 4th pair this year and at $55.00 a pair I have mixed feelings on the purchass. He loves that they are comfortable from the first time he tries them on and continue to offer foot support and comfort even as they start to fall apart and look crappy.
"These are decent shoes, but the padding inside each shoe is glued in place and they are already showing wear after one week's worth of use. It might be okay for a shoe that costs less than $30, but for these ones I can not recommend them. They do look nice, and the fit is not bad. The toe support can be hit or miss, since the pads bulge slightly to support the arch of the toes. This worked fine for my right foot, but is not very comfortable for my left foot."
"The cushion inside the sneaker is very comfortable.  The tread on the bottom is tough (so you can get lots of wear out of it), but very pliant (not stiff), which makes walking enjoyable.  I like the width of the heal (I sometimes turn my ankle on uneven terrain, but this sneaker greatly reduces that possibility), which offers greater stability while walking or running.  I purchased another pair as well."
"These are my first pair of Sketchers, have purchased other brands with memory foam before, but the sketchers seem to have twice the thickness of memory foam. Making them much more softer and  comfortable, great for your feet and back.<br/>Fit and size were spot on for me.<br/>I've only had them for a week so far, so can't give 5 stars, will update after a couple of months wearing and see how they hold up.<br/>But so far soooo good!"
