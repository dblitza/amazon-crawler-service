review
"The style update ""V4"" of this shoe has much less padding around the heel notch (top of the rear heel) than the prior versions. It's a shame because I loved prior versions of this shoe (this is my fourth pair of MX608) but the new V4 design gave me blisters at the top of my heel the first time I wore it for a long walk because the rear edge of the shoe is so sharp. Because this became apparent only after longer use I felt I could not return the shoe, but I am giving them away.<br/><br/>I was hesitant to write a bad review because I bought the shoe online -- maybe it's my fault for not buying shoes in a store to check the fit? But as the problem is due to New Balance's redesign I thought I should share it.<br/><br/>My Wistful Note to New Balance: Why do you insist on ""redesigning"" this shoe every 1-2 years? Are your designers bored? Do they have a quota? Does removing 3mm of padding save a few cents on production costs? We humble customers fell in love with your shoes because they are high quality and comfortable. I would have happily ordered new pairs of MX608 online for the rest of my life, but now I have to go shop for a new brand. Sigh."
"Fairly light weight and very comfortable. I am not an extreme athlete, but I am heavy (215 lbs), I have bunions, and I over-pronate when I walk and run, so my shoes take a beating. I've only had these a short time, but so far they seem to be up for the task. Gone, it seems, are the days when New Balance sold shoes by emphasizing different materials and technology for different foot and stride types, and when their quality was second to none. These are still good, but I don't know that I bought the ""right"" amount of support, or what specific material might be in the layers of the sole to improve my workout. Of source, no one else does that either, so I guess the measure is simply in how well I like the fit and style, and whether or not they last as long as I expect. For now, I am pleased with them."
"Have been wearing them for years, a number of different numbers but all resembling the #608. Dependable sizing, great durability and long lasting comfort. And let's not forget how well theu clean up after another day in the back yard."
"The two pair I have just purchased are the 4th and 5th pairs I have owned.  I'm 6'4"" and weigh 245.  I also have foot issues.  These shoes are like walking around on clouds.  They have excellent support and a wide base sole for stability.  I purchased two pair because I live in them and even shoes need a break. I would consider them to be cheap at twice the price.  I have paid $200.00+ for shoes that were not half as good."
I usually hate buying shoes on line because you can't try them on but since I have been getting similar New Balance footwear I decided to try ordering these.  I am a woman with a wide large foot and find it hard to get women's sneakers.  I wear an 11 in woman's.  These were wider than ones I have gotten in the past in New Balance which was great.  First wear on the treadmill gave me a blister but I should have known to break them in first.  They feel great now and have wonderful support for my arches.  Love them!
I have had many pairs of NB shoes over the years. They fit me very well and are comfortable. It’s really been the only brand I buy. This pair are very disappointing. After only four months of light duty wear the surface on the toe of both shoes is bubbling and separating. I am past the window to return them so I am stuck. When they peel I’ll trash them. That won’t be long.  I will be shopping other brands now.
"Second pair this size I have bought my husband; they hold up well and give great support and comfort for whatever he is doing. A great, dependable all-around shoe for an active guy! I wore the women's version for years as a bedside nurse - never a complaint."
This is my 3rd time buying New Balance 608.  I just like how they cover my feet.  This time I had to order 1 size larger to get the right fit (wear a 9 1/2 but had to get a 10 1/2).  I wore them to the gym today.  They are a little bit stiff so they will need to be broken in some before they fit like a glove.  They look well made unlike some other reviewers have stated.  Only time will tell if they hold up from the abuse at the gym.
"I've been wearing 608's since they first came out. I was hoping these V4's would have the same fit as I can't stand a high arch and sure enough, they feel great after 4 hours of wear time out of the box. I think they may run a little larger than the original 608's, but it could be my memory. My old 608's are so worn out that I can't read the size on the tag any longer but I seem to recall they were 12.5 US size, which is what I ordered the V4's in and they feel about a half size long in the toe. It's not a big deal as they don't roll or slip on my heel so I'm not going to worry about sending them back. All in all, if you like the fit of NB you'll like these as well. Very happy with my first Amazon purchase."
"After 3 days the front orange part of the shoe started to peel off and the soles in the shoe are not even in place and mushing around in my feet while working. I am getting very annoyed with New Balance shoes high price and lack of good quality shoes like they were 10 years ago. They throw gimmicks at me in the store like ""these 150 dollar pair of shoes are made in America"" and "" these shoes have a roll bar technology"" well guess what rolled an ankle and the bottom the those shoes were peeling apart. The 608 are cheaper yes but for the shoes not being able to last a week at work is very PATHETIC and DISSAPPOINTING. Yeah being 7 foot 3 may have an affect walking in a pair of shoes. Engineered by someone who is GUESSTIMATING accomodations for a Tall man has to be difficult but the shoes feel like they took the dimensions of a size 13 shoe and tweaked it in cad or something to make it work for bigger feet. As of 9/11/2015 there has been a flopping in right heel and also a squeek noise when I push off that shoe. The shoe looks very sharp but the quality is starting to lack A LOT!"
"Having worn New Balance tennies for years, I can assure you these have thinner leather, are lighter weight and generally inferior quality than those I've had before.  It seems that New Balance is making this ""downscale"" line for Amazon so they'll be cheaper and ""pop up"" closer to the top of a search. I don't recommend this line, although I plan to continue with their regular line of shoes."
"My husband has wide feet and we previously purchase a pair of Brooks sneakers. The sneakers were wide, however, not wide enough. Kenny wanted to purchase another pair of New Balance sneakers and when they arrived he put them on and was out the door, so excited with the great fit and being so comfortable. We would recommend these sneakers, Kenny for the great fit and style, me for having a happy footed husband.<br/>Thank you, New Balance!"
"I now have four pair of the New Balance 608s, if that tells you anything. These are my 2nd pair in white leather. The other two are blue, and gray suede. Fit is very good and they seem to be well padded. Great for walking but I reserve two pair for working out in the gym. I work out five days per week including 20 minutes on the treadmill or track. They hold up well. Recommended."
"I recently went up a half size for more room and comfort. Been wearing New Balance for years in a size 10.5 but after measuring my foot it was obvious I need an 11. Also, I've always bought a 4E in NB shoes and this last pair of 11 4E size I received were very tight in the toe box, putting pressure on my big toe, so I had to return them. I wish these had a more square toe box."
"Did not know how to write a a review because they don't fit. It really was my bad though because I wear a thirteen and the largest size they had was a 12.5. I was SOOO looking forward to these shoes because I'm older, work on airplanes and am my feet all day. I have only heard excellent things about this product which is why I ordered them. I know your return policy. Is there any possibility I can return these.???? Thanks. David"
"It's not mesh, which makes them nice and toasty if you are living in the colder climate.<br/><br/>The support is pretty good as those I paid for much more.<br/><br/>Only wish they last longer, liked 9 months to a year.<br/><br/>I only wish more training shoes are completely black like these.<br/><br/>Hello, manufactures, you know that solid black color sold out the first, right?"
"I originally purchased the New Balance shes due to the shape of the toe box,  Now I order and reorder<br/>due to the toe box, the general fit, and the distance I get to go in comfort.<br/>  The shoes arrived on time, and were well protected in shipping.  Would I recommend these to others,<br/>Too late, I already have, and have reordered for myself.  I just like 'em!"
"I recently purchased this particular shoe for my husband. He is continuously reminding me that New Balance shoes are the only shoes that fit him perfectly. He is correct on this point. No matter the style, and there have been several different types, all have fit as if they were made specifically for him. This particular purchase of the New Balance MX608V4 Crosstrainers were chosen as an every day casual work shoe. My spouse is on his feet most of his 10 hour work day and usualy on concrete or other hard flooring, therfore he requires something that can handle the pounding and the pressure his feet go through daily. I personally have found crosstrainers worked for me so they should work for him. There were several color options available but I was looking for something to wear in a casual office environment, therefore I chose the brown suede. For the last week, everyday when my husband walks in from work he exclaims how these shoes are one of the most comfortable pair of shoe he has ever owned. He actually said they ""are more comfortable than the $250 Red Wing shoes I bought"".  As an added bonus, I bought them for under $50. I think at that price I may surprise him with a second pair to have when the first pair wears out."
"These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I have a condition that looks like Gout, even though my uric acid level is normal. The base of my big toe is very swollen, and most shoes compress that, and that causes varying amounts of pain. These shoes have a stretch panel right behind that spot, and this relieves the pressure, and pain. These shoes also have more cushioning than my previous shoes, so that makes these shoes AWESOME. I have been wearing New Balance shoes for 25 years, because of the 4E width, which don't exist in other brands.  Of course the lowest price and 2 day shipping make this deal unbeatable."
"I changed from the sued MX623 to these leather cross trainers. I wear  them everyday alternating two pair with the seasons, different colors. Both pair fit great, especially after a brief one day break-in. I had sole and upper material of construction problems with NB shoes. I'm hoping these will hold up at least one season. I am resigned to the fact that these shoes will not last more than one year. That's OK with me."
"These shoes are great. My son has been wearing New Balance shoes for the past 8 or 9 years or so and he really likes them. He started with NB because they used to be made in the USA however, in recent years they are now made both in the US and overseas.  Even so, he still likes how they are made enough to stick with the brand (which says quite a bit).<br/><br/>These shoes look and feel great on him. They are surprisingly lighter than what I would have expected based on looking at them. The shoes are very rugged and durable and feel like they are good quality. The soles have good traction and they are easy to put on, tie up and adjust the width and also walk in.  The width of the shoe fit him very comfortably with some additional room to spare -- there is also plenty of room around the toes. He has also said that the insole is very comfortable to step on and feels good on his feet when walking.<br/><br/>Overall, he likes these shoes and said he would definitely want them again."
"I've always liked New Balance,but for some reason the left shoe always feels like my foot is walking only on the rightside of the shoe and your foot is sliding inside the shoe.  I bought this size in a medium width knowing it would be a little tight to stop the sliding effect, but it did not help.  It could just be me getting older but then who knows."
"Probably shoes are as individual as anything people buy.  This shoe fits me perfectly, allows for my custom orthotic to fit in. I had been wearing a New Balance 623 but this seems to be a similar shoe, better made and better looking.  My last pair of 623's squeaked badly and I could not find a solution for that problem.  This pair fits perfectly and looks really good."
"Years ago my podiatrist recommended New Balance shoes.  With metatarsalgia, I have to wear inserts. I have consistently bought New Balance shoes and these were exactly as all the rest - good fit, good construction, good quality.  Previous New Balance shoes have lasted me 2-3 years and I don't see any reason why this pair shouldn't last that long."
"My teenage son thinks this look very bland and uncool, but I have always considered such a shoe, in all black, a classic and very useful.  One thing I like especially is the small loop behind the ankle which helps to pull them on, because my main gripe about past shoes is that if you step into them, eventually the foam will roll and stick to itself, rendering the shoe uncomfortable and ready for trash.  I wish the design would be modified to stitch the foam in back and hold it captive so it can't become dislodged.  Or, I shouldn't step into the shoe, but I suspect many people do (plus it is uncomfortable for me to do otherwise due to various injuries."
"Most comfortable training shoe that I've ever worn!  After working out in this sneaker, I ordered two more pairs just in case. It's soft but supportive and LIGHT.  The only change that I made was to install thicker laces. This is one great shoe for training if you have wide feet. Easily the most comfortable trainer that I've ever used."
My husband loves there shoes it is all he wears probably the 8th pair I have purchased for him in 10 years. Came as expected looked great. Hubby wears a 4E shoe so it is hard to find shoes he likes these fit a bill!
We have used New Balance products for over twenty years and have always been happy and satisfied. This pair is smaller than I expected and fits tighter in the toe than previous pairs. I should have ordered a half size larger. However the quality is there and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the size not the quality.
"Great shoe style that I have worn for years. I'm a big guy (250lbs), and I need solid foot support, plus I pound the crap out of sneakers doing 3-4 miles a day on my treadmill. After weaning these for about a year as ""dress sneaks"" they are my daily treadmill foot wear and last about 7-8 months. Which I think is just fine."
"This is a nice comfortable shoe.  It kinda looks like an old man shoe.  My buddy makes fun of me and calls them my ""Wendy's burger cook shoes.""  However, this is like my sixth pair.  I wear them at work because the floor as granite, but the shoes are very comfortable.  One pair lasts me between 12 and 14 months of Monday through Friday usage."
"Usually my husbands right shoe fits tighter then left. In case of these the right shoe was fine and left was way too suffocating tight.  Did an exchange with amazon for another pair. The new pair arrived with the same problem. Returned both.  Considering the fact that this is the model that my husband wears constantly and he is on his 20th pair, I have my doubts that these are authentic New Balances."
"These NB 608 shoes fit perfectly.  With the proper insert, they are comfortable as a 1300 series trainer shoe.  This is my second pair.  They last about 9 months of daily wear for work or a casual use..  The heal padding is the first thing to go but that has been true of all my New Balance shoes.  I'm sure I will buy them again."
"New Balance is the one of the few shoe manufacturers that care about people with wide feet.  Most of the other manufacturers must think we can just go barefoot or suffer in a shoe that is too tight. I would love to get about 10,000 people with wide feet and sue other companies that refuse to make wider sizes.  In this day and age where everything is handicap accessible at the cost of millions and shoe manufacturers refuse to accommodate someone with wide or narrow feet?  New Balance has the insight to see a real market here and it has paid off I'm sure!"
"When I seen these NB's, sold by Peltz Shoes and carried on Amazon, I was definitely interested. I have trouble finding 2E's and here they were.  They fit perfectly, very comfortable and look great.  The grey color is a nice change from white.  I will be ordering another pair , as I know the fit and comfort of these shoes."
"New Balance shoes have been running small. I never thought I would order a 12, but that's what it took to fit my foot with the current build of New Balance. That said, these are very comfortable, and have a splash of color that you don't always find of NB cross training shoes. Would buy again. A good value, and arrived promptly."
These are great and comfortable shoes. New balances that wider feel better and any other shoes my dad has purchased. I ordered these for him as a gift. These are great and comfortable shoes. New balances are a bit wider and feel better and any other shoes my dad has purchased. I ordered these for him as a gift. Love you
"Bought in housemate's usual size and though the width was perfect, the toe box was confining to the point that it pressed his toenails down and gave him a blister. Purchased him some rayon-bamboo socks that are thinner than usual and after a week or so of breaking in the shoes, they seem to do with the new socks. Not able to wear regular dress socks or athletic socks with it. The next size up was unavailable at the time in this colour, or would have purchased those to compensate for the length. Not a bad shoe, so far it seems to be holding up well and reasonably well constructed for the price. Have always liked the amount of padding in New Balance tennis shoes!<br/><br/>A note on arch support - it should be fine for wearing for casual out and about or a day of flitting around, but these are not proper running or training shoes, in my opinion, if you need any sort of firm arch support. If you are looking for a daily walking or running workhorse, I personally enjoy Asics Kayano Gel line, although some of the newest iterations of that shoe have changed a bit, and not all find those changes improvements."
"I need to revise my review. I have ordered this same exact shoe many, many times.  This particular pair is a bit too small.  I checked the size and the proper size was sent.  I also tried on the pair they replaced and they fit fine.  These are just about a thumbs width tighter.  I can't wear them for any extended time.  It's a pity I wore them too much to return."
"New Balance....<br/>My Go To Recreational Shoes for Decades :)<br/>Tremendous Fit, Comfortable, Well Made....<br/>I use these everyday at home, at work before retiring, camping, hiking, walking just recreating &amp; having fun :)<br/>Fabulous Heel &amp; Foot-bed Comfort!<br/>Retired Park Ranger Mike &amp; Renee<br/>Yakima WA"
"Finally found sneakers that feel good! Very comfortable! I have been a size 10 for many years and these are even on the smaller size. These will do, but still not the quality of my old sneakers that were made in the U.S.A. All manufacturers need to do a better job of controlling items being imported ... or start manufacturing here again!!!"
"New Balance is my favorite brand of jock shoes, and 608 is my favorite NB shoe. I loved these 608s so much that I quickly ordered a pair in a different color scheme and am watching for a good price for still others. I have two older pairs of 608s in a style not available on Amazon. They are well past their 500-mile limit for fitness use, but still look and feel great for casual use. I like these all-leather 608s best for winter and wear the lighter-weight 411s with a lot of mesh more in the summer. I'm a Type 2 Diabetic, not using meds, controlling it with diet and walk-walk-walking, and I care about my appearance, so I'm rather picky about jock shoes. This pair's color combination is a special fave. I try not to wear them too much. The laces are a bit long, but that is much preferable to too short."
"Not the shoe's fault. This is just one of the snags we encounter when shopping for shoes online. I've worn NB shoes for years, so there is no complaint on that front. These just felt a bit too tight in the toe box. I'm currently wearing out a pair of 623s, so I returned the 608s and bought another pair of 623s. Variety may be the spice of life, but I like a sure thing.  ;)"
The 11 4E feels somewhat tight at the start... the leather will stretch out I hope...I bought 5 pairs in mutiple color combos.. sizing in the royal blue seems more generous compared to others... The cushioning in the grey blood red is something new for the's sneakers... I will have to update as they wear...
As usual I am extremely happy with my new shoes. I have been wearing New Balance in on form or another for 25 years. Probably but new once every couple of years. Keep uptake great work!
I wear a size 17 shoe.  You can imagine that I have to search for shoes that fit and are affordable.  These New Balance trainers are perfect for me.  I am so pleased to report that they fit perfectly and are really good looking. The price here on Amazon was considerable less that special ordering them from a store.
"this is my 4th pair of the 608 line.  i mainly walk about 3 miles 4 times a week.  occasionally might do something else.  I tried other new balance ""walking shoes"" but always come back to this ""training shoe"" one for the following reasons: 1) stability with wider heal and footprint (2) fit is perfect for my foot-i use a 2E in most new balance shoes (3) leather uppers give additional support to the shoe and comfort (4) shoe is extremely comfortable and my feet never hurt. I am 6'6"" 220 lbs and wear a 14 2E. I have tried the 623 model, but like this fit better, in case you were wondering."
"Purchased these for work; which is an all day standing/walking job. I no longer wear these shoes as of last week. The inside padding is worn down so I can feel the sole structure underneath the liner. The upper part of the shoe is ok. For the first time I developed very painful heel issues over the past couple of months. (Since I stopped wearing these shoes the heel pain has almost disappeared.) The amount of money I have spent on inserts could have been better put into a different pair of sneakers.<br/><br/>These shoes look nice and have a wide base. However, they are not made to withstand long daily use. If a buyer intends to only wear them occasionally, then these would be alright."
"My comment is ""why do they make the shoelaces so dang long???""<br/>I'm just getting around to use these shoes purchased in December and I decided to get new shorter laces for them. They came with 56 inch laces and I just put in 45 "" laces which are plenty long. New Balance, shorten your laces !!!"
New balance always makes a great product that fits me like a glove. Love the support and most comfortable shoes I wear. Got these for taking walks after my surgery and I can't say enough positive feedback about them. Makes the transition so much easier on me and my feet. Arrived on time and undamaged. Great show and seller tpp. I will recommend to anyone.
"I recommend getting sized before you buy any shoe. I used a barefoot step-on sizer, for lack of a better term, during boot camp (military) and they properly gave me this size and this brand. I am no longer serving but I know exactly what shoe size to buy from this brand and continue using these as my running shoes."
"For years, I would wear 9 1/2 New Balance shoes.....sometime down the road...things changed.....about a year ago I tried size 11, because 9 1/2's are too small now....the 11's are a tad big...but they work....so I figured on these 608's I would try 10 1/2....fit great...my new size is 10 1/2."
"I've been trying to find a solid pair of New Balance for a while.  I generally like how they fit, but I find that the materials aren't always durable.  I especially have problems with anything that has mesh uppers.  It doesn't take long for things to get stretched or develop holes.  So I was thrilled that these were non-mesh.<br/><br/>They held up for about six months before seams started to separate, and now it seems like something is wearing down on the right side of the right shoe, pretty much exactly where my pinky toe would hit.  Didn't expect my pinky toe to be strong enough to start wearing through the material, but here we are.<br/><br/>My wife is ready to kill me at how often I seem to buy new sneakers (and I only buy them as needed) so maybe it's time to find a new brand."
"These are cushy shoes that fit well and serve me well for walks of 3 miles. I use flatter shoes for cross-training work, but these would suffice if you were looking for walking and cross training shoes in one. The earlier models I ordered had less of a drop, and were not as bouncy-cushy as the latest pair. I preferred the older ones."
"If you look at the tip of the shoe, you will see a ""lip"".  In the past, this has not even been noticed, but on this pair (left shoe), the lip came unglued and then the shoe began to fall apart!!<br/>A little Gorilla Glue put everything all back together and holds very well!!<br/><br/>Overall, the shoe fits well and provides excellent stability and support."
"608's are the best shoe that I have found for overall wear, walking in the morning (because the doctor said so) and all around otherwise, third pair I have had, wore the other ones out.  Really do like the looks of these to, not a color that you see every day, they look better in person."
excellent! no 'memory foam insole.  I found the memory foam remembers the deformation on my feet and very promptly becomes so thin there is no support.  I must pull out the liner and tape an 'across the counter' support onto the bottom to support the deformation.  New Balance has always been true to size and excellent support and it took only one memory foam to learn .
"I was a little worried ordering for the on-line fourth time in four years for the lineage of the old New Balance 608's. Appeared in the reviews that they might be cheap and poorly put together and ""just not as good as they used to be"". I was worried....<br/>So I pulled my white and black 608 V4's out of the nice boxes, checked them closely, put them on and now have worn them for a week or two;<br/>Wonderful!  Perfect fit, seemingly well constructed, and I like them much better than the year old 608 V3 edition that they replaced.<br/>So far, they are just the wonderful cross trainers that I have worn for ten years or more and my feet feel younger than ever!<br/>Heartily recommend from my experience."
"I have always had issues with finding stores that had my width of shoe plus the style I wanted. This fit the bill and keeps my feet comfy. Office dress shoes, even properly fit ones, don't offer the cushion these offer . I am going to see about wearing something similar to these in the office. I am very happy with them."
"Great walking shoe. My husband has a problem callused foot and these shoes help with that problem, but after 8500 steps, these shoes become hot. We'd love to see these shoes in a little lighter weight material such as a breathable substance. Overall rating is the confidence we have in New Balance and their desire to produce confortable walking shoes."
This shoes fit the same as my NB 577's and have removable insoles that allow me to use my arch supports without any alteration of them. They're comfortable. I have only had them a little over a week so only time will tell how well made they are. At this point I am well satisfied with my purchase.
Fine for lifting weights. No support for even the elliptical.  Feet hurt after just 20 minutes. Would not purchase again.
"Wore these shoes for about 8 1/2 months.  Soles and uppers show very little wear, but sole of right shoe came unattached from body of shoe. I liked them while they lasted, but normally I can wear a pair of shoes much longer until either the sole is gone, or the uppers start to split."
These are very comfortable and great looking. I bought another pair in a different color after getting these. I have a size 14 foot and I don't usually buy shoes online because I'm a tough fit but I thought that I'd give it a shot because of Amazon's great return policy.
"New Balance, To Me,  is the best athletic shoe on the market. They Fit like a Glove and feel like walking on a carpet. They wear well, both in the sole, and on the upper body.  Sizes run very true.  I have been a fan of NB for 30 years and STILL continue to be. GREAT SHOES !!"
Here's a tip.  If you are older you should think about checking your shoe size.  I was a 17 for quite a while.  My socks were bugging me and I thought it was the socks until I bought a pair of shoes size 18.  All is great now.  You feet keep growing.  Pay attentions.
"To be fair to the shoe, size is always a bit of a hit and miss event, and it's not as though my feet slip around in them - there's just more room than I expected. I was replacing some very worn out keens at size 14/4E after four years, and have very wide feet, so a little extra room on the length is expected, and a little extra width isn't an issue. It's roomier than the Keens they replaced, and I'm only going to the office these days rather than tromping in semi-rural Japan.<br/><br/>Very comfortable, very good heel support which is important to me - my right foot tries to roll out and back habitually, and I'd ground down that part of my previous shoes through wear and tear. This shoe is correcting that without being uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Very warm shoes - I have to take them off now and then beneath my desk. But if you get cold feet on a regular basis, I'd definitely recommend them. And my need to nudge them off and on probably contributes to the slightly loose feel.<br/><br/>Very comfortable for a good price, and accommodating to my wide feet, happy I could find 4Es. In theory I probably could've gone with a 13/5E, but for going to work every day these are perfectly fine at a great price."
"My son loves them, they are very comfortable and with his wide foot it is hard to find good tennis shoes that fit him well. . Love New Balance for their great fit and durable shoes.  I have learned when buying shoes you get what you pay for and New Balance are well worth it."
"I love these shoes! I bought these as a replacement pair in black, for the navy ones I used to own. I wore them down until there was not much left. They fit just as great as the previous pair did and provide ample support for everything from yard work, day to day wear, weight lifting, running, etc."
"I got these for my son; my husband and son only wear New Balance athletic shoes. I ordered a few different styles and sizes for him to try. And though these fit OK, the backs of these shoes went up too high, rendering these unwearable for him, which is the only reason I deducted one star.  Everyone's feet are different, so this may not be a problem for some others, but it can be, as it was for us. I guess as with any shoes, you really need to try them out for yourself.<br/><br/>So unfortunately, we did need to return these and get another style. However, overall, if the back of your ankles/heels are high, then I think they may be worth giving a try. If yours are lower, then you might want to try the following: He ended up with the New Balance Men's MX636 Training Shoe, and the backs were lower and these fit him like a glove - he loves these. He said they were really comfortable from the start and still thinks they're great."
"These shoes were purchased to wear with a uniform (khakis/shirt) for a volunteer role that requires standing for long periods of time on pavement and concrete. They are tremendous! Super comfortable, supportive, and look close enough to a casual dress shoe to look better than a running-type sneaker."
My husband wears these for work shoes and loves them. He said they are so comfortable and have such great support that there is no need for breaking them in. I ordered two pair because he liked them so well. He is on his feet alot on concrete floors during the work day.
I have  grey and brown pairs of this shoe and both are rough suede but this pair is of an almost smooth material that doesn't feel like leather . the shoe laces are much thinner than the other two pairs also . I wish New Balance would't change their specifications and stick with what works . This pair feels cheaper than my other New Balance shoes . They almost feel counterfeit  although I know they're not .
"Best fit ordered on line to date.  Superior to Nike, which was a bit stiff and tight even though published sizes were identical.  Very comfortable and easy to put on.  Limited wearing time till now, so cannot comment on longer term wear and comfort, but out of the box I am very pleased.  Certainly meets comments and input from third parties ignored until now due to Nike fixation.."
"These are great walking shoes.  I would not recommend them for running though. I have been away from running and bought these for walking on a treadmill and as a leisure shoe.  I am going through a ten week walking program and hope to begin jogging at the end of April.  I just purchased the New Balance Men's Vazee Pace Running Shoe for running and will be reviewing them shortly.  I am a huge fan of New Balance. They support Americans with jobs and don't make weird shoes, like some companies.  Maybe I am too traditional or maybe I don't like people staring at my shoes as I run by."
Shoes came quickly and well packaged. Now heres the interesting part and this isnt the sellers issue. Some years ago New Balance change their sizing so  if you wore a size 14 you have to order a size 15 to get your shoes to fit. I have old pairs marked 14 that are exactly the same length as the new 15s. New Balance also changed the cut of the width at the forwardpart of the shoes making them slightly wider for the same width as earlier shoes. If you have large feet like me youll severely notice the difference as compared to say a size 8. The shoes are comfortable and fit OK but not as well as the older styles of New Balance. This is the 2nd time Ive been disappointed by New Balance and I think Im going to start looking at other brands.
"I've only had these shoes a short time but have worn them several times now for good amounts of time and love them.  I got the 2E width because I have a somewhat wider foot and they fit perfectly well.  I was a little surprised at the comfort level as I wasn't expecting a lot but the comfort is great and it has much more arch support than I was expecting too.  All in all, I am extremely happy with the 608 and plan to wear them all day tomorrow for the opening football game of the season.  That's how confident I feel about the comfort of this shoe.  I got them in the grey color and I think they are a very nice looking shoe in that color so that's a bonus.  Highly recommend."
They work great for me the fit is perfect I use a dr. Scholl's custom orthotic that you can pick up at any Walgreens or other drugstore that carries the fitting machine that is required to determine which orthotic is proper for you I highly recommend you give that a try with any of your shoes. They have a machine that you stand on and it measures your foot not precise but for weight distribution and then recommends the proper orthotic for you which they have right at the machine they're not cheap but they're a lot less expensive than a custom orthotic and they work great for me I recently got back from Spain where we did a tremendous amount of walking and between the shoes and the Orthotics I did just great. And I tend to have problems with my feet when walking on uneven surfaces which are all over Spain. Good luck.
This is about my 6th or 7th year with the same style and I love it. They arrive early<br/>and fit just right. My old ones are now my yard work shoe and the new ones are my<br/>knock about in. And yes if you mistreat them the soles will separate......Thanks
New Balance is the only tennis shoe i buy.. As usual i can buy 13D without trying them on and always a comfortable fit . i usually like the upper # shoes but i like these all leather shoe i can where for casual outings look nice. I recommend these shoes
"This is my third pair of 608s, and version 4 extends this line of very comfortable shoes. New Balance obviously is listening to previous wearers who love the fit and the comfort, but weren't so entranced with the look. This version of the brown suede 08 is darker, and the ""N"" blends a bit more into its background. It's still obvious that this is a NB crossover shoe, but it looks almost elegant. I can certainly get away with wearing it in my daily work, except for truly formal situations.<br/><br/>And that's good, because this is really my go-to shoe for comfort and support. The included insole is a simple piece of foam rubber that is easy to pull out and replace with your own orthotics. Good thinking."
"I picked up a pair of these for work.  I had been looking for something all black that I could wear that was not a dress shoe. I needed something with a bit more comfort for the day to day.<br/><br/>I still have a pair of leather dress shoes under my desk for use when needed.  Since these are black, I am not sure anyone really notices."
Replaced 6 year old NB similar to this.  The sole seems a little bit lighter.  Don't know how well they will hold up in comparison.  But over all satisfied.  Fit just like the 6 year old shoes I wore almost everyday.  If I get 4 years I'll be very happy with them.
"A little larger than I expected but that was expected, I have been buying New Balance  shoes for over 25 Years,They were really good comfortable shoes and lasted for as long as I wanted to keep wearing them But a year ago that all changed.The last ones i purchased only lasted about 4 months. The soles just started coming unglued and fell right off like they were glued on with water soluble glue.The company I bought them from Went out of business about that time.That pair of shoes w #MX623AB3  Mfg 12/20/2015.They sure were Junk I Just hope these are Better Made.Thank you for asking, I am 80 years old and pretty easy on shoes.Herman M."
Fantastic shoe for that price. I installed a beefed up insert when they arrived and you can keep your $200 athletic shoes; these are great and comfortable and fully supportive in all areas of my feet. Get a pair and torture them and see if you agree.
"Like the style. The fit, not so much. A bit narrow. Too early to rate the durability.<br/><br/>Update June, 2017: Hard to believe it's already been well over a year. The shoes are holding up well, look good. Even received some compliments. The shoes fit better now, either they have stretched a bit or my feet have shrunk. For that reason I'm changing the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars."
"I have worn NBs for many years. My last ones, MX623, developed a stress crack in the vinyl uppers, near the toe.<br/><br/>I looked for leather uppers on my replacement shoes (MX608V4) to enhance durability. The ad on Amazon said ""leather"" so I ordered them. They arrived today. They are comfortable, though do not offer much arch support. I have quality inserts to use, so that's not a big issue.<br/><br/>My big complaint, however, is that I could find NO LEATHER anywhere on the shoes.<br/><br/> I shall keep them; it's too much time and inconvenience to exchange them."
"I really like the fit, performance and comfort of theses shoes.  The only problem I have them is that the tread has a tendency to come loose from the sole.  While this can be reattached with 3M 4200, it is a disappointment in an otherwise well-made shoe."
"very comfortable - I have flat feet and usually get New Balance because they don't have high arch supports.  A nike will either fit you, or if that arch is off, is going to wear you out.<br/><br/>Unusual color - gets compliments, go figure."
I have sensitive feet that are also short (mens 7.5) and wide (2E).  Hard to find comfortable shoes.  These fit well and are comfortable.  Adding a note some time later:  I love these shoes.  I can walk long distances on all types of surfaces.
"Very comfortable. Nice walker. Why 4 stars not 5. I once owned a pair of walking shoes I'd kill for. Years ago, can't remember the make and model. Never took note being young, I thought all walking shoes must be that comfortable. 10 pairs later I'm still looking for them. This comes close. Think it was a Hush Puppy but I've tried several models and they where very disappointing."
"I like this shoe, as it looks stylish and meets my expectations for an everyday casual shoe.  I am a little concerned that it will not do well if it gets wet.  I have avoided wearing them in the rain so far, so I don't know if my concern is warranted.  My only negative is that the shoe runs on the small side.  I ordered the same size that I have worn in other New Balance shoes, but this model seems significantly smaller."
"Not all New Balance 608 v4s are the same.  Some of these like the ""Dark Brown"" are shipped with the standard foam insole and are not comfortable.  Some are shipped with NB ""Memory Sole Comfort Insert,"" made from memory foam rubber, and are very comfortable, like the ""Dark Grey/Navy.""  Check the photos carefully for the different colors of 608 v4s offered.  The ""look down"" photo that shows the inside of the shoe should show the ""Memory Sole"" label.  The good news is NB finally has come up with a 608 (this v4) that rivals the original NB 608 for comfort, but be sure to get one with the Memory Sole insert."
"I felt it was a bit wider than most other EE New Balance shoes.  Generally, I wear 10 1/2 EE shoes in New Balance athletic shoes.  These came with memory foam.  I don't like the memory foam because I have specialized inserts that don't work well with it.  That being said, they are still better than most athletic shoes.  The arch issues are my feet solely.  (rimshot!)"
"Nice cushioning. Comfortable for all day use. The only thing I didn't like was they don't have normal eyelets for the laces. They have those cloth loops that tend to rip. Didn't notice them before I made the purchase. Other than that, it's a good shoe."
"For big guys with 4E wide ""Frankenstein"" feet like me,  New Balance is the only athletic shoe that fits me properly.  Sizing is consistent on the ultra wide width shoes, shoe is very stylish,  and it's comfortable to wear all day. The dark charcoal gray suede color is rich, deep,  and it looks good with the dark red accents.  Shipping was perfect,  delivery on the expected delivery date,  and packing was great.  Happy  yet again with Amazon!!!"
-1 year update (well.. 11 months)-<br/>The shoes are beginning to show some wear. The fabric on the insoles have bare spots and the heel on one is torn. But the shoes have held up well for the cost. I don't have a habit of taking good care of my shoes and I normally only own one pair. So these have been abused and are only just ready for replacement after a year. Not bad at all.<br/><br/>-original review-<br/>I have fairly wide feet. I measure Men's 10 4E when given enough room for wiggle. However I can rarely find 4E wide shoes in the stores so I normally go with a 10.5 2E or 11 2E which is still perfectly comfortable if just a tad loose. Since you can never be too sure about what one manufacturer's 4E is going to be compared to another buying shoes online has always been a risk for me. I was pleasantly surprised when these shoes arrived and they matched my measurements exactly. A perfect fit!  This shoe is very tall with a thick cushiony insert. Very comfortable.
I searched for a long time for a really nice shoe for walking. I am typically an Adidas guy but gave these a try. I was not disappointed. They are light and feel really good on my feet. My walks are between 6-10 miles a day and my feet never feel fatigued. The only issue I have is the inside of the shoe near the heel has worn away and I am now getting blisters. I have been using mole skin on the inside of the shoe and a band-aide on my heel to keep if from rubbing.
"If you are 200+ pounds (like me) I do not recommend these.  They are not very stable and have little arch support. I feel all sorts of motion in them, and my feet ached at the amusement park.  If ur lighter, they just might be fine."
"I really like these shoes but they were too small. The insole would not lay flat and that made the shoes uncomfortably tight. The shoes are 11-1/2, 2E. The insoles are stamped 11-1/2 4E. They were just too big to lay properly. They are also gel filled so I don't think I could have successfully trimmed them to fit. I have a pair of these shoes in size 11.5 D. I've worn them for the past 6-7 years and they've been great shoes. They are finally wearing out so I'll use them for yard work. It seems that they are cutting them smaller these days. ottom line? If you can order a size larger than you normally do, they are great shoes."
"This was my first pair of 2E shoes and it won't be my last!  I have worn New Balance shoes for a number of years and in my opinion, you can't go wrong with New Balance.  I think this design is very stylish--- and very comfortable."
"Bought this for the wife and she loves it!  According to her, it is very comfy, looks awesome and is her favorite shoe.  She's a farmers' daughter, so these are the shoes she mostly wear.  She said the memory foam is just awesome."
"I have had foot pain for 10+ years. I finally saw a podiatrist, and he recommended these New Balance Training Shoes specifically (model 608). These are WONDERFUL shoes. I spend 10-12 hours a day on my feet on hard concrete, and my feet do not hurt wearing these shoes! This makes the third pair of these I have bought, and the are all awesome!"
"I have tried many cross-training shoes in my time and the new balance 608 series are the best for fit and comfort!  Don't even try other new balance cross-training shoes, you will not be satisfied!  I have owned over 8 pair of 608 over my lifetime!"
Took a chance and bought some shoes online. They fit perfectly. I have super wide feet and finding comfortable shoes is hard. But these I love... so far
"These are good looking and a nice weight.  The size is accurate.<br/><br/>I do have a problem with them that you may need to consider  I have an extremely high instep (quite rare I'm told) and I also wear custom orthotics.  The combination causes the upper part of my feet to rub at the top inside shoe surface.  Wearing thin socks works around that problem, though my preference is a thicker padded sock.  I can wear the shoes comfortably without the orthotics for a day or two before having to again swap out the insoles and return to the thin sock.<br/><br/>My guess is that the vast majority of people won't have the issue that I do.  Without the oorthotics or with a more normal foot these would be outstandingly comfortable."
These are the most comfortable walking shoes I have ever owned. Also acceptable as hiking shoes due to the superior support and heel base. The suede makes them dressy enough and appropriate to wear to work and going out in the evening. The fit is perfect - no pinching or pressure points - even after walking and hiking for 3 hours. Highly recommend this product.
Wear them at my gym for weight and aerobic exercising. They appear to be a durable shoe which should last; they almost seem like hiking boots. Very comfortable and supportive. They were a replacement for a pair of NB cross trainers which lasted over 3 years.<br/><br/>I bought the widest width and a half size larger to avoid any restriction in the toe area. Even with the wide width there isn't any slop.<br/><br/>The only drawback is the shoe has a large portion of suede outer material. This is an issue only in the winter  months when you walk through a salted/slushed parking lot. I leave these shoes in the gym locker.
"This pair of shoes provide a comfortable fit.  On purpose, I ordered New Balance because of previous satisfied purchases and ordered the size one size larger than the last time that I purchased shoes.<br/><br/>I am 74 years old and am still a growing boy.  The proof is that my shoe size gradually increased from 12 D to 15 D over the last 25 years.  I will soon be ordering new shoes to replace my dress leather shoes, which are now too small and are a pain to wear.  I want to wear these new shoes for a little while to make sure that they are the right size and not too small.<br/><br/>Gerald Wood who is EAW spouse."
"I like this shoe, but over the years the stated size seems smaller.  Yeah, feet grow as I grow older...  Really?  Started at 8.5 am now at 9.0 edging toward 9.5.  However, 9.5 is not a commonly available size for some reason.  I'm still going to buy the shoe, but..."
My husband (who has a very difficult time finding shoes that don't hurt his feet) absolutely loves these New Balance sneakers.  He says that they are one of the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn.  I would definitely purchase these again.
These shoes are O.K. but the toe boxes are too narrow and the insoles have no arch support.  They are well constructed so they won't fall apart before you wear them out and the soles absorb a good amount of shock when jogging.
"I like this shoe. I don't love it. May just need more breaking in. Seems a bit stiff but durable. I like the way they look. As I get older, my feet seem harder to please needing more arch support and toe space. I maybe should have gotten them even wider. All in all, a good price for a good shoe."
"Fits as exspected, ok for occasional use, they wear out quickly when worn 10-12 hours daily."
"Good quality.  Good fit.  My son wears a 4e in New Balance and a 5e in propet.  Most other brands don't even carry his size.  Here's hoping that this style is more durable than his previous style, which only lasted 6 months."
"I reordered the exact same shoe that I have enjoyed for a few years now, and just as before, they fit great. New Balance is the only shoe I have found that accommodates my wide feet comfortably. This show is great for walking and for jogging; I highly recommend!"
"I was concerned with this purchase because New Balance shoes that I have purchased in the past seemed too narrow.  This pair of shoes fit me well.  I like the styling and the quality seems decent.  The price is fair for what you get.  I will wear these shoes in the gym on the treadmill and elliptical trainers.  If I get six months out of these, I will be happy.  Shoes I have purchased in the past (all brands) tend to fall apart at the rear ankle part of the shoes.  I never thought I would be buying shoes on line.  Everything in the local stores were too flamboyant and awfully expensive.  The selection in stores these days really stink.  Psychedelic neon running shoes, not for me!"
"I am happy with these shoes. They look good, are reasonably priced, and are very comfortable for me.  Compared to the lasts of other brands, the New Balance last fits my feet best with its comparatively lower arch and narrower heel."
second time ordering these form Amazon as it is the best deal for wide fit
"I like the New Balance 680's!!  But I have to admit, when I first put them on, I felt as though the heel was very low; like wearing slippers.  I don't think these would make good running shoes (and they're not advertised as such), but I think they will be great for pickleball and general wear-around-the-house use.  After a few hours, they felt fine.  I have found that typically, if New Balance fitted you well years ago, they will likely fit you well now.  Sneaker manufacturers seem to use foot models that they continue to use for long periods of time.  As a result, New Balance and Saucony's work well for me, while Nike and Adidas don't fit nearly as well."
I really like these shoes.  This pair is to small.  I will try again.  The larger size is perfect.<br/><br/>I like these shoes are perfect for me.  I bought another pair.<br/><br/>Thank you for such a good product.😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
"I have always liked New Balance shoes.  They are more comfortable for me than other name brand walking/athletic shoes.  I really like it that I can buy the 2E width online.  All of the local retailers I have tried only carry D (too narrow for me) or 4E (way too wide).  New Balance has always performed well and lasted a long time for me in the past.  The only issue I had with these shoes was that the shoestrings that came in them were too long.  When tied, the bows almost touched the ground on both sides of the shoe.  This was easily fixed with a replacement set of laces but I don't think I should have had to do that right out of the box."
"Received my shoes today and they are great! I wear a size 15 EE, and these shoes give me a great foundation to walk! Amazingly, they are lightweight, stylish, comfortable, and my feet feel really secure! I like wearing these shoes with beige pants, they look great! New Balance is the only gym shoe I will buy because of it's well made quality! Also, the soles have a great grip, making walking in water attainable! New Balance gives you great Balance!"
"I love these shoes, but now find that my feet perspire more than ever when previously purchased...in 2013.. <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/New-Balance-Men-s-MX608V4-Training-Shoe/dp/B00IYAG7DW"">New Balance Men's MX608V4 Training Shoe</a> The Amazon website states that this shoe is leather.  I do believe the site is incorrect and needs to be corrected.  These shoes are definitely synthetic.  I hope Amazon looks into this matter and makes the correction.  I have purchased many pairs of these in the past and they previously were leather, but since they are no longer made in USA, they have switched."
"New Balance 608's are my husband's go to shoes for work.  He is a nurse and on his feet all day.  He is also a diabetic and has a bad leg with multiple screws and plates near the ankle.  He has to wear good fitting, supportive shoes and the 608's are what works for him. I hope they never stop making them because they are usually hard to find.  I was so pleased to see them here at Amazon!"
These shoes wear the best on my husband as he is on his feet all day
"Very good shoes that help my problem with bunions, arthritis and age.  I had to order larger size and width.  Took a little getting used to but the shoes are holding up well and doing what they are supposed to do.  Would buy them again."
"Bought this because of bad knees and tired of wearing uncomfortable dress shoes, so adopting the old man look lol. Shoes fit and feel wonderful and can walk in comfort. The all black design helps to not stand out so bad when wearing dress clothes. Have read others with problems of coming apart and bad seams due to glue. Have had none of those issues. Will prob buy another pair to have as backup in case they quit making them."
"I brought the New Balance Men's MX608V4 Training, for my son, because we have problem find his sign at the regular store; and he love it, he said is confortable the color is okay, and met his expectations and need."
I got these for my son who works long hours on his feet on concrete presently to help with pain in his feet and knees after reading reviews that they are helpful for those situations.  They seem to be a good shoe.
"I only tried them on so far but I love them,they fit excellently and are nice and light. I don't think you could get a better shoe for the price . I've had shoes for more money that I liked less.<br/><br/>New Balance for life !!!"
"Shoes fits just fine and are comfortable.  I have a bought several pairs of these shoes in the past. The only problem I have with them is after a few months of wear the sole becomes detached from the top of the shoe.  The glue they use just does not hold for a long period.  The shoe becomes worthless, and I have to replace them even though the shoe top and sole are still in good shape.  Perhaps the manufacturer wants it this way so they can sell me another pair of shoes.  Sometimes I wonder why I keep buying this brand."
"I have been using the NewBalance 608 shoes for some time now. This is version 4 of this shoe. It's a bit wider than its version 3 counterpart. If I had known it wouldn't fit the same, I'd of bought the v3. Still, a good shoe."
I had this same one before that I somehow lost. it was a very comfortable and lightweight shoe for a disabled person to wear daily. I am now reconnected with my favorite shoe. everything on it is cool and I will continue to wear it as long as it holds up.
"I've found that New Balance shoes have been the most comfortable shoes for my feet. I have High Arches and have had Planters Fasciitis previously, so I have custom Orthotics that I use in my shoes. I previously had the MX608V3 Cross Training New Balance and they have been extremely comfortable to wear and durable. I'm not real active so mainly wear them just casually. This MX608V4 does not seem to be as comfortable on my feet. They seem to be stiffer and the footbed padding seems stiffer, making the ball of my foot (below my big toe) become sore. Remember, I use Orthotics for my arch support so can't speak about that, but the overall comfort of the V4 compared to the V3 is not as good. I'll keep them &amp; hope they loosen up more."
"Husband has very wide feet and will suffer lower back pain standing all day.  These shoes fit perfectly and provide good arch support and did not suffer back pain or leg pain wearing them all day.  I was surprised to learn this particular model of shoe has been approved by Medicare if you are a diabetic.  This gives me peace of mind in our decision to purchase as they are very well made.  They were well packed and arrived on time.  Will be purchasing another pair in the near future.  I recommended them to a family member who is a diabetic but his condescending reply was you have to spend $700.00 for it to be a good shoe.  Well, the joke is on him, we didn't have to spend that much to find a quality shoe.<br/>Thank you Amazon &amp; New Balance shoes!"
"Just Size issue.  Still a Great shoe if you get the right size which has varied (for me anyway) from the last model.  T he v3 has been a favorite of mine except the slippery traction somewhat.  love this updated v4 because of  its new soles....bought two pair. one for work and one for play and they both fit the same....toooo small.  I usually wear 11 but I tried on the V3s in 10.5  a year or so ago when I got mine (a couple pair to make sure it was feeling right) and they fit fine with xtra room just like normal 11s in other shoes for me.  So I went with 10.5 for these new v4 and they are short/small.  I have to go up to/back up to a 11...and hope they are OK. I've read some reviews about the consistency of NB sizes being off and now I experienced this.  Online shoes charges for returns from Amazon, yet said free returns on there website.  should have gone with there website initially.  needless to say not happy and if charged for shipping despite email, I will not be buying from them again."
"I don't know if it just happens in my size, but for the last couple of years New Balance shoes have predominantly had uneven footbeds.  They have ""peaks and valleys"" under my foot.  This pair had a pronounced dip under the big toe area which made the shoes uncomfortable.<br/><br/>I appreciated the free shipping return and the promptness of my refund."
"These run really small.  Not just a half size but a full size too small for me.  I have to exchange them.  Normally I can get a 10.5 4E in New Balance and be good but these require one additional half size larger which would put me to a size 11--and this is in 4E!  That's ridiculous.<br/>Other than that, they are more flexible than  other New Balance shoes I have worn because they have an extra flex slit on the very bottom of the sole which makes them more comfortable to me.<br/>One thing I noticed is that there is a indent or hole type thing on the heel of the outsole.  This seems to add cushion as I noticed a springy like sensation in that area which is nice.<br/>The toe box is on the small side as well."
"Suppose to be leather. Can't find material description on shoe or box. Why? Not buying 409s anymore because they are mostly synthetic materials now. Suspicious of New Balance, will try someone else next time."
"I have wide foot, somewhere between D-2e I guess after wearing these. They seem to be on the big side of 2e. I bought them for boxing, so often I feel my foot slide in side the shoe, and lose my balance a little when moving around.<br/>Also, the heel forms a suction cup on soft gym/wrestling mats, again a balance issue. I didn't encounter this much as I try to stay on my toes, but once in a while it happened, and was not a good surprise.<br/><br/>I would say they would be a good gym/walking shoe, but leave them at home when doing anything with a high level of movement and/or agility."
"I ordered a 7D in men's (which is my correct size and equals a 7 regular width) and it is way too small and tight. I am currently exchanging for a 7.5D although I would have liked to do the next width up but they were out of stock. I kind of feel like I might need a size 8, but I will wait and see how the 7.5 fits first.<br/>This is the first thing I've ever returned, and I was surprised how easy and quick the process is. Aside from the size issue, I love the shoe. I haven't been able to find completely black New Balance shoes anywhere, and I like the material they are made of as well."
I have bought these shoes for many years but it seems like the last few years the quality has taken a nose dive. Whatever glue they are using is terrible! The sole starts to come away from the rest of the shoe within a few months. I don't know how many times I've had to crazy glue it back together. I'm sure they know about this problem but they haven't seemed to fix it.
Very comfortable shoes.  I struggle with constant foot pain and it is hard to find a shoe that is all day comfort.  My podiatrist recommended these shoes.  He said several of his patience have had good luck.  He was right!
"Love these sturdy, well-made shoes - and I'm so appreciative that they make wide sizes available; bought a 12.2E, and it fits so perfectly - no claustrophobic narrow, blister-inducing, cramped shoes here!"
They fit me perfectly. I have been using them for my tennis for the past week and they are amazingly comfortable. Even better than my last pair of New Balance shoes that I used them to replace.  Great value.
"I buy these shoes for my boyfriend every few months. He walks a lot, and really is hard on shoes. These are the single best pair of shoes he could own as far as comfort, and not leaving his feet sore after a long day. He loves them."
I live in a small town and would have to travel an hour to a NB store to purchase shoes. I know my size and the #NB shoe I wanted.<br/>Thanks Amazon! You are a lifeline to the larger world. The price was great as well.
I love New Balance shoes! They are the lightest shoes that I've ever worn and they really hold up well! I've been wearing New Balance shoes for over twenty years now and I will never wear another brand.
"Very poorly made, will never buy again, upon opening box and getting out shoes noticed the inside insole was not even in the shoes. I cannot wear the shoes no inside sole. Amazon cannot wear this shoe."
"I bought these for my dad, They are the only shoes he will buy for work. HE LOVES THEM! He has been buying the same shoe for YEARS, he works about 60-70 hours a week at least, all while wearing these shoes, His job is very physical and very demanding and these shoes hold together for him about a year sometimes more."
"These are a really good shoe at a great price!  New Balance as terrific removable insoles and great support.  I cannot say how they hold up for a runner, but for daily normal wear they are terrific."
"My highest rating is a 4* because I believe the highest and lowest ratings should be thrown out.<br/><br/>I've been wearing these sneakers for work and play every day for the last 4 years.  I've gone through 4 pairs in that time, and typically use my newer pair for work (I'm a retailer and am on my feet all day) while keeping my old pair for weekends and yard detail.  As far as durability goes, these are great.  I'm about as far from a runner as you'll find, however these work great for my daily routine of walking, crouching, kneeling, climbing, and generally moving through my day."
"New Balance shoes aren't as good as they were when they were made in the USA, but you still can't beat them on price. Also, they make my feet feel great. I've been wearing NB for the last 17 years."
Why is it that different manufacturers all seem to have their own sizing??  Is there not industrial standards?  So frustrating.  Apparently I am now a size 9 1/2 EE?? I am normally an 8 1/2 normal.
Wonderful shoe.  I have been wearing the same model for years.  These are a different color that I like much better and at a better price than I paid for my old ones.  This was my first time online purchase of shoes.  I figured I couldn't go wrong since they were shipped with Amazon Prime as I could return them if needed.  So far I'm really pleased with them and I will buy them again when mine wear out.  Thanks Amazon for selling my shoe.
"The pair I have is brown, unusual in my experience, and really nice!  They fit supremely well and are exceotionally comfortable. I am still amazed that I found them by surprise and couldn't be happier to own them."
As I get older my feet are much more sensitive and I think they are spreading out.  So I'm giving these a tryout as I exercise: a half size larger in length and next size the wider.  So far so good.
"These are the most comfortable shoes.  I know New Balance makes great shoes, but every day when I wear these, I am thankful for how comfortable they are.  I wear them 16-17 hours a day.  Love them."
"Been wearing this model New Balance shoe for years, so I knew what size I needed (9.5EEEE).  I wear a 10 in Nike Monarch's but New Balance I wear a 9.5.  Excellent shoe, great foot support.  Arrived on time and in perfect, new condition."
"I like the style, very comfortable, but the sole has a manufacturing defect with the glue. I have had 2 pairs, and both had the sole start separating from multiple points. I glued it back together, but after happening twice on shoes I bought a year apart, I don't know if I can buy them again, which sucks because I like the look of the brown ones (Which is why I re-purchased despite the sole defect)"
I have been wearing New Balance 608 shoes for years and am very happy they still make them. Great shoe if you have a very wide foot. I walk hundreds of miles in every pair before I buy the next and I have bought over 30 pair of these shoes.
"New Balance is the best shoe I have found for comfort and proper width for me. I use them for the gym, walking and casual wear. The only reason I rated this shoe as 4-star is the arch support. I suppose theirs is fine for most people but I use an insert recommended by my podiatrist because of my need for greater arch support. (If strong arch support is the primary concern, I would suggest you consider Merrell's for that).  I have 2 different styles of New Balance and love them both! Best improvement in recent months is the oval-Shaped shoestrings which stay tied without having to double-knot them! Thank you New Balance for that!"
"Had to change style of shoe I had been wearing because of discontinue.  This seemed to be similar and turned out to be an excellent replacement.  New Balance shoes are great for my active lifestyle, my feet do not hurt at the end of the day as with most other shoes."
"A well made shoe, durable, comfortable with extra wide/with 2E or W for Wide.<br/>This brand New Balance shoe have multiple option as to shoe with W 2E 3E wide.<br/>Perfect fit all the time."
These shoes fit the first time I put them on. I have wide feet and have a hard time finding shoes that fit properly. I also have heel pain when I have shoes that fit properly. Since wearing these shoes no heal pain. I work two jobs and am on my feet up to 13 hours a day. I have no heel pain at night or in the morning when I wake up. Can not say enough good things about these shoes
"They are cheaply made, but were on sale for just over $30, so what could I expect. They will do for the gym with good inserts. if you are looking for a sturdy shoe, look elsewhere. the ""memory foam"" inserts are kind of a joke."
"Shoes are a difficult item to review because it really takes a while to break them in and make sure they're doing what you want, etc. I'm a fairly big guy so I burn through shoes pretty quickly. I'm probably not qualified to write a great review of shoes, but I'll try.<br/><br/>Pros: Fits as expected (an 8.5EE is fairly rare, and more rare that one fits well), seem decently supportive<br/><br/>Cons: This is tough to describe, but generally when I get walking/hiking shoes, I can feel a ""spring"" in my step for the first week, what with all the cushioning usually in those types of shoes. With this one, I don't feel that. I'm not sure if this means it's NOT very supportive, or if it's just a subtle thing. It definitely feels like my feet are better supported w/these than my old, worn out ones, BUT I always really enjoy that ""new springiness."" We'll see how they feel in a month. I'll try to remember to update at that point."
"My husband is on his feet all day long, besides squatting and kneeling etc., and a few years ago he found these sneakers at a shoe store and knew right away these were the ones, he has never looked back. He wore his other pair out - literally. However to get him to go to a shoe store is like getting a child to eat their vegetables! So when I found these on Amazon, we entered the product number from the inside of his worn out sneakers and 'boom' there they were! I ordered them immediately. When we got them less than a week later and they fit him perfectly - my husband was thrilled! He was also tickled that he will never have to go into a shoe store again. Great Job! Thank You!"
"New Balance size 12.5 has always fit me before in at least four or five previous pairs of shoes. This pair my toes were hitting the end of the shoes. I also have a narrow foot and order them when New Balance offers them in the shoe I'm buying. This shoe wasn't offered in narrow width,so as I've done in the past I buy Dr sholls inserts that compensate for the too wide shoe. I didn't even get that far with this pair because they were too short. I exchanged the shoes for 1/2 size larger shoes and with Dr sholls inserts they are comfortable. The flat shoe laces are harder to tie and are way too long.."
"The quality of materials and build construction of these shoes is a little less than what I would expect from New Balnace, though over the years that has become true of more and more of their shoes.  I have very sore feet so no shoes are likely to give me all-day comfort but these do quite a good job of provide good support and comfort for normal wear.  I question how well they would stand up to hard use or heavy training.  The price I got them for was surprisingly low so I consider them an exceptional value.  I feel much better about ordering shoes on line when they have Prime shipping and free returns (within reason)."
"I have been buying these for years, and they always fit great. I liked version #1 the best, but have learned to accept change, I Just hope they never change the last for this particular shoe."
"I needed to buy solid black tennis shoes.  New Balance is my favorite brand and wasn't available in any of the local stores. Someone said it seemed risky to buy shoes online without trying them on first. But I have bought New Balance shoes for years and a size 9D always fits me perfectly. These shoes fit as well as always. I have to walk and stand all day on hard surfaces.  Although I have only worn them a couple of days they are comfortable enough even for a 10 hour shift.  I am a tall woman with larger feet to match. I have to wear men's shoes because women's shoes are not made in my size. A women's 10 is too small, an 11 is too large and unfortunately they don't make women's 10 1/2 shoes. But thank goodness the men's 9D works perfectly."
"Fit was a bit snug, but wearable. They did not have the rigid support in the back of the shoe, causing the back to collapse when you try to put it on. All my other New Balances have a plastic support in the heel."
"I love these shoes, I've been wearing them for years. They do get a little warm on my feet at the end of the day, but everything I've tried does the same thing, it gives me an excuse to kick them off at the end of the day!"
"I own another (older) pair of these shoes and both pairs are terrific for my cross training.  I usually do light running, walking, trips to the gym. Although the arch support is decent, try adding some ergonomic inserts if you need more support (for plantar fasciitis as an example).  My only complaint is the cheap, thin laces.  They cut in to the top of my foot--wish they were thicker.  If you have a narrower than average foot like I do, New Balance tends to be a little too wide, so you'll have to tighten up the laces to make them fit properly.  Overall though, a good shoe."
"I wasn't expecting much. I just wanted a cheap pair of good looking shoes, and I liked the look of these, so I bought them. Then I tried them.<br/><br/>These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my entire life. I had no idea it was possible to make a shoe this comfortable. It's like my foot is surrounded by pillows while walking on blankets. The bottom of the shoe changes shape as you walk which makes it even more comfortable. They are a little warm due to all the cushioning, but they're so insanely comfortable that it's worth it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for comfort, these are your shoes."
"Nice and comfortable but my feet moves around in them. I wouldn't call this an athletic shoe. Too stiff and bulky and does not fit tight enough. It is great for walking but not sports. I'll wear it till it wears out then I'll get something else. My fault for buying something unfamiliar on the internet. There is nothing wrong with this shoe. It is very comfortable. I just wouldn't recommend it as a ""training shoe""."
"I've always like New Balance. However, I was a little concerned since the width was advertised as 3E and I've always fit in 2E. When the shoes arrived, it had a 2E on the tag and fit just fine."
I have been wearing this shoe for 10 + years  (or a model just like it) and have never had an issue.  I wish they had 13.5 size but the 14 fit OK.  I actually like a slightly loose fit.
"Buying shoes online is a pain in the rear if you've never worn the brand before and don't know how it fits. I've been wearing NB trainers for a long time, so I know how they fit my feet and what size is right. I was pleased with the fit straight out of the box, and the shoes were comfortable for a workout the first time I wore them. They were equally comfortable when I wore them to work all day. I'm happy that NB continues to offer a solid black trainer, as I use them as travel shoes. Unless you're wearing a suit or formalwear, very few people pay much attention to men's shoes, so I can wear these with pretty much anything else while traveling overseas, both saving me packing space and weight, and making sure my feet stay comfortable. I hope these shoes last as long as my last pair did (5 years)."
"The 608 4E is very wide.  Best extra wide I've ever owned.  I only gave them 4 stars because they are very dark brown, nearly black.  The previous versions were a nice medium brown."
"Good shoes for walking fit just right, last pair lasted me over 3 years, would purchase these again if needed."
"Very good comfort and arch support. the only drawbacks are that new balance has cheapened up on the materials of the shoe itself.  In addition, the soles of the shoes wear out much quicker than previous versions of the 608's.  I gave it 5 stars for comfort, for quality,  only 3.0.  Also, the cement used in the manufacture of the shoe gives way, the sole separated from the shoe after only 6 months of wearing.  I do like the memory foam inserts, comfy.  I've worn new balance many years, however if the don't address the quality issues, I may consider a different brand next time."
"For my feet, these are extremely comfortable. Normally I need a lot of arch support. These feel great for me. 9-4E.<br/>I used these on a 2 week vacation, touring Japan. We were walking 10 to 14 hours each day and these felt great. A inch of stitching of the right shoe near the metatarsale fibulare came loose, so I easily sewed that up with one of those complementary small sewing kits in the hotel room. That fix seems permanent."
"My husband always has two pairs of New Balance Men's MX608V4 Training shoes.  He uses one for work and one for casual wear.  His work requires him to stand on concrete for long periods of time on some days, and this shoe provides the support he needs.  It also comes in 4E width that he needs, and is difficult to find in a good shoe.  He has been wearing the New Balance 608's for years because they provide the support, width, and comfort that he needs and enjoys wearing."
"I been a new balance customer since the mid 80's after growing up wearing those old canvas converse sneakers yrs before...remember them?  I'll still call them sneakers no matter what their ""official"" designated name may be.<br/>First time ordering them online though but it worked out good. These replaced my worn out 608's.  Size fit perfect and the comfort is as expected. I'll order here again next time."
"Great fit, Comfortable even at work on concrete floor. Shoe laces stay tied. The removable shoe inserts are nice for awhile but need replacing within a month with something like Dr Scholl's inserts but expected that."
"Great shoes. I have unreasonably wide feet (4E), and it seems like New Balance is the only company that seems to understand how to make a truly wide shoes that fit well and are also good for athletic activities. I like these shoes quite a bit."
"Husband likes them, bought a second pair before he can't.  He also owns theNrw Balance 'hiker' in this color/style as well.<br/>These are nicely made.<br/>Wider width option."
"This is a great shoe, especially if you are prone to pronation (your ankles roll in).  New Balance is recommended by podiatrists for pronators- which is why I buy NB shoes.  I'm very pleased with these as they don't cut in at the toe, like some of the newer lasts do.  I like this last shape better.  The support is great- but I put an orthotic in as well, and the 4E gives me enough room to do that.  I am on my feet all day in these.  Love them."
Bought for husband as we have trouble finding a size 6.5 wide walking shoe. So there weren't many to choose from. The reviews seemed to be complimentary and I did see where a few stated they would be good for walking. He's worn them 3 times now and no complaints. He said they fit very well and they are very comfortable.
I noticed my last pair of NBs were snug up to the toe.  I took the dive and ordered a half size larger than I usually wear and these are spot on with lots of room for sport socks and a firm and secure fit.  First trip was a 4 mile hour on the tread mill with a good incline.  I could not ask for more and I promoted my old pair to yard work and spent 3 hours mowing the lawn in them.  Still lots of life there too after more than 3 years on the tread mill for many many miles.<br/><br/>I have long sought out NBs because they were made in the U.S.  This pair was not!  I did not think that they may be foreign made.  This may account for the small sizes and the decline quality other reviewers have observed.  My next pair may not be NBs after 30 years and many pairs.
Quality workmanship and well finished. The shoes are much lighter than I expected. but they fit well right out of the box and needed little or no break-in period. I use them for treadmill and light workouts. I would not recommend them for running or extended walking.
The only shoe that does not bother my plantar faciitis. Last version the sole separated. Hopefully this one will not have the same issue since the sole design is different.
"Comfortable, with lots of cushion and support for a person of size, without some of the support arches and ridges that many shoes have that end up pressing against a person's foot in the wrong spots. Love New Balance!"
"Haven't worn them much but the fit was very good, looking forward to it. Seemed good value for the price , must wear awhile to be sure. Great to have in what used to be obscure or forsaken sizes i.e. 4 E width.<br/><br/>Now that I have worn them (two pair, one brown, one black) I cannot say enough good about how these shoes feel.  I go to several trade fairs each year and have finally found the shoes that will carry me through the hikes from hall to hall and back again.  The quality of manufacturing starts out well and I hope I can report endurance when I order my next pair down the line."
I am going to try to put some shoe stretchers in the shoes to see if that help. They are just a tad short. I guess I will keep them  I have so much trouble sizing shoes.
Good shoes. Delivered as promised
I LIKE THEM A BIT WIDER THEN THE NORMAL SIZE.  THEN I JUST SLIP THEM ON WITH OUT ALL THE TYING.. YOU DO NEED A SHOE HORN OR A FINGER TO DO THAT :)<br/>THEY ARE NICE FOR WALKING
"I don't think these are size 10 us.ive been wearing this brand for ten years and these feel a little smaller than usual,but I think they will stretch.maybe new balance has changed something.i don't know but they usually make a great shoe"
Just ordered my 4th pair. I walk any where from 6 to 8 miles a day every day. I went back and checked my orders. I've ordered a pair every 3 months. You can do the math.
My husband wears size 18. It is hard to find shoes that fit. These fit as expected. They wear down fast if you are wearing them everyday. The color is uglier in person than on here.
"Ordered the size I normally buy in the stores. As with any new shoes, feet got a little achy by end of day but that because my old pair are stretched  out. Pleased so far."
"These were too tight in the toe box for me even though I have the 608s VZ in a 9.5 and love them. The newer version hurt my Mortons Neuroma. I would have returned them, but didn't save the box. I ended up giving them to a friend. They also were not comfortable around the ankle. They look good on my friend's feet and have a nice style."
I love the shoes but they hurt my Achilles heals if I don't wear socks tall enough to cover it.<br/>The shoes look great and fit great and I would recommend buying them.
"I have very wide feet. (EEEE)  I find that the New Balance shoes consistently fit better than other brands that claim to be for wider feet.<br/><br/>I also like that they are made in the USA.  I know that's no longer important to many folks, but it makes a difference to me."
"I really like the shoe. There's just one problem...NB manufacturers their products with extreme cheapness. I've never been able to actually wear out a pair of NB's, the bottom part of the sole ALWAYS comes unglued before they are worn out. Which always leads me to check out other brands before buying another NB products."
"My husband fell ill last year. He can not feel much from the waist down. I really couldn't afford good shoes for him, but I got a few gift cards to Amazon. He needs to wear his shoes tight but the other sneakers kept breaking at the eyelets. The shoe comparison was amazing on what shoe size to get for these sneakers. I was able to get them for him for Christmas. He loves them! They fit great and he says they feel better on his feet. I would recommend them to anyone and using the shoe sizing tool on Amazon was great. I don't really like to buy shoes unless they are tried on first, but these fit great. Thank you for making a good Christmas present for him!"
"I am very unhappy with these sneakers and will be sending them back for a credit.  This is the third pair of NB ordered in the past two months.<br/>I've never had this problem, to this extent, with mail order shoes....that is over the past 25 years!<br/>I've only walked around in the house on carpeted floors and the shoes felt like the support insole was missing.<br/>Also, I ordered a half size larger that the largest shoe normally wear and my toes are at the max inside.  I also ordered EE width.  This feels somewhat improved from the normally worn  D width.<br/>Sorry, without the insole, I cannot recommend or wear these shoes."
"They are OK for the price. However, they are not of the quality(comfort, support) I get from my more expensive NB shoes. the bottom line, you get what you pay for."
"I've been wearing this New Balance training shoe for years, in white/navy and black.  It is the only shoe of it's type I've found that fits me perfectly and is amazingly comfortable.  I've tried similar Nike and Adidas shoes but they simply can't match the overall comfort.  It's all in the arch design and cushioning.  The 4E width is perfect for my feet.  Thanks New Balance!"
I bought a pair of these a couple of years ago from a local retailer and loved them. I have bad feet and these were the best I have worn. I've purchased several other brands and have always been a Hi-Tec man but their shoes have become inferior. I even tried some of the high priced options like Merrill and gave them away to my son.I ordered these a couple of days ago since my old ones are starting to show wear. Wearing the news ones today and they are just as comfortable as my old ones. Great job New Balance.
Comfortable shoes that should clean up pretty well each day after being an Umpire. Good price for a solid shoe. Wow! Amazon's one day delivery got it to me in less than 12 hours. How do they do it?
The 4E width is as wide as I expected and need for my feet.  Gray is nice color compromise that goes lots of my clothes.  Comfortable all day long for walking.
"This is my second pair of these shoes in black. The previous same model shoe I have purchased in blue. The only drawback is that the shoe laces are way to long and will need to be replaced. I bought 45"" replacement laces and changed them out. If they came with the 45"" laces I would give these shoes 5 stars."
The shoes are just like all of the other New Balance shoes I've purchased.  They are very comfortable and supportive.  I'll be buying them again in the future
"It appears that these ""608V4"" (Version 4?) have a little more room by my big toe.  In the older  original 608 shoes I have had a 1/2"" of toe seam break.  Other models before the original 608 were fine, and it appears that the 608V4 are also fine."
"My foot must have enlarged with age because I used to wear 12M and when I bought the 608 in the past it fit fine.  I bought a 608 recently and it was too narrow.  These in 12 2EE fit in terms of width.  Hope they last as long as the older shoes.<br/>I've now worn these shoes further.  I cannot continue to wear them.  Indonesia production to save material makes them too short.  My toes hit the front and and begin to hurt after a few minutes of walking.  It's probably too late to return them so I will have to give them away and lose ALL my money.<br/>Make sure you wear them inside your house for a while and if they don't fit, return them immediately."
New Balance shoes are just not as comfortable as they used to be but still the best fit I have found.  Just plan on purchasing some GOOD replacement insoles.
"This is a very comfortable shoe for me, and I have a wide foot.  I use these as everyday/all-day shoes and they work out great.  Good price/performance ratio."
my size fit great friend love the style and look this is not the 990 I used this for  my back up can' be the price and comfortable.<br/><br/>  great shoe
"These are my husband's favorite shoes. They are wide enough, even with inserts. He has been wearing them for years. Amazon has the best price and service."
"This is the first shoe that I have purchased that fit me Just Right. I took a chance by ordering a pair of shoes on line because it is so hard to find a shoe in the stores around that half way fits. I am glad that I took the chance.It seams in the past years the shoe sizes have changed. I used to ware 10 1/2 D in US size before the ones made from other countries started flooding the market.They did not offer a size that fit until now. I do wish that a pamplet would come with these shoes that told what the shoe was made of. Thank you , Sincerely, Bill"
I bought these for work and they are a life saver. My feet are really bad. I have bunions and flat feet and have a very hard time finding a comfortable shoe. These fit great and are very comfortable. Highly recommend.
"I waited a few weeks before writing my review to see how these shoes would break-in and perform over time, but these shoes are awesome. Extremely light weight and comfortable out of the box, and they get better with each run."
A little stiff first workout but feel great now. Just treadmill miles now but soon the weather will let me get outside. I am a walker now but want my running days back. Haven't had New Balance in a while and I am pleased with them.
"My husband loves these shoes.  Other shoes tend to break down on the outside, I guess because of the way he walks after bi-lateral knee replacements.  These tend to hold their shape a whole lot longer than other brands."
"Returned them. Zero arch support. Really disappointed, actually. I was looking for a more stylish alternative to NB 577s, which are fantastic walking shoes, but look like rounded, clunky black bricks. These are not it. If you need arch support, don't bother. I use Superfeet Green insoles, and even with them, this poorly-designed shoe provided no support whatsoever."
"These are just what you would expect from a New balance shoe.  I wear these to work, which is business casual, and they look fine and are very comfortable.<br/><br/>I will buy these again (ok, this purchase was a repeat and I have bought them multiple times before... since they work well for what I need)."
"I have an ankle that has over 30 fracture lines, all the bones separated from the leg bone.<br/>As a result, I run over the heels of my shoes horribly. I searched extensively on Amazon<br/>and finally decided on New Balance because of the availability of a 2E width, broad heel and a reinforced<br/>heel counter. Long story short, to coin a phrase, I ordered them, arrived the next day, fit perfectly and now<br/>2 months later have by far exceeded  my expectations for wear, support and comfort."
"I purchased these New Balance shoes, because my previous New Balance shoes, have worn out, after a few years. They are so comfortable, durable and very nice looking! I don't need any other type or brand. I've tried other brands and just nothing has compared to these!<br/>  You can't go wrong with this purchase and there's no breaking in. Anyone would love these!"
"Husband loves these, it's his forth pair over the last few years, he uses them at work and walks all over the complex and they are always comfortable!!"
"Based on past experience, I knew the 608 was a great shoe. This was my first time ordering them online. There were no surprises at all. They fit and looked great."
These were for my husband - pretty close to the ones he purchased in a store about 4 years ago.  So he knew the brand and the fit and ordered accordingly.  They fit great!  He could probably wear them all day but is handicapped and can't stand all day.
"I Love these shoes!! I run the mail room so I am on my feet a big part of the day these shoes are so darn comfortable and look very cool too. I was worried at first because they are very well made not like a regular sneaker that is why I call them shoes. Not that New Balance sneakers are not made well but these are different when you see them you will know why I say that.... they look more like a shoe. Anyway you cannot go wrong with these they look good, feel good and the price is reasonable."
New Balance makes a great shoe. Wish they still made the old 608 itself instead of the V shoe. The V shoe doesn't fit and feel as good as the old 608/
"I've worn New Balance for almost 40 years. I hope the pair I received were an anomoly. The shoes started to fall apart on the third day of wearing...indoors!<br/>I have opted to have them replaced to see if it's just a bad pair.<br/>UPDATE: these shoes are awful. I hate them, that are uncomfortable, and make noise when I walk, and I would love to return them. New Balance has turned to crap. Amazon please help me. I want to return these shoes."
"My husband wears these shoes for work and it's hard to find a size 15 4E in stores.  I can always rely on this to be here, I've ordered many of these."
"I tried the New Balance Men's MX608V4 and found the Nike Air Monarch IV to be a far better shoe, although it is a little more money.  Relative to the Nike, the New Balance has a very stiff sole and feels and looks like a really cheap shoe.  The sole of the New Balance was so stiff that my knees were hurting just trying the shoe out around the house.  I've been wearing the Air Monarch for years and after a few minutes with the New Balance I decided to go back to the Air Monarch.  The Air Monarch is very comfortable and is a great shoe for tennis."
lengthwise these seem to run just a little bit smaller than normal. Otherwise great shoe and very comfortable. I would think about a half size larger.
I wear them daily for about two years before they start to fade. On my third set now. They are more comfortable than other brands that I have tried.
dependable
GREAT
"Wear and fit well; however, did not receive the shoes I ordered and expected. I order the 626. Shoes are fine. Company from which I ordered is doubtful"
"Due to foot problems I am very selective about my shoes.  I go through several returns each time I shop for a new pair because you never really know how a shoe will fit until you try it on.  This shoe lived up to it 4.5 star review.  The fit is as expected, it looks great, there is plenty of support, and it is built ruggedly enough for winter and rainy walks.  I did have to replace the insoles immediately because they were too thin but i suspect that will not be the case for the average buyer."
"Great to have v4 after v3 disappeared so long ago! I am completely satisfied. Great price; prompt delivery, as stated. Will purchase here again as needed."
"My husband loves these New Balance shoes, orders them all the time.  Not a very trendy design, but a comfortable, supportive shoe with good traction."
"Given my wide feet, NB is one of the few options available to me. At least these have been a consistent fit throughout their lines (mostly).<br/>This pair in particular fits as expected and is holding up well enough for daily work-week use. They're eventually fall apart, likely inside 2017, but I've been pretty hard on them."
"Great shoes for walking and moderate running. I run about three times a week, 2 or 3 miles each time. This shoes suit my purposes and great price."
I got the New Balance Men's shoe for my Husband. It fits him perfectly  and he still likes the brown color. He exercises as well as rides the Harley with them!
"I haven't worn these sneakers yet, so I can't speak to how they'll last or wear.  However,  I can tell you how they fit.. I've been a perfect size 12 medium in all New Balance sneaks for as long as I can remember.  When I ordered the 12 in this model, they were WAY too tight.  They were crushing my toes in the front.. I went back and read some past reviews and others has the same experience..  I returned the 12 and ordered a 12 and a half.  The half size made a big difference and now they fit perfectly."
Seller allowed me to exchange for 1/2 size larger - Excellent fit - very comfortable. To be used solely for exercise in gym (no street wear) - should hold up over long haul. Shoes appear to be sturdily built - so they should not fall apart as some other reviewers mentioned. The laces issue is normal (probably have to be replaced every year or so). The cushioning provided is very easy on feet - one might replace with 3rd party inserts to get a really soft feel. Overall would recommend these shoes as good value for the money. Might want to consider getting 1/2 size larger than your normal size as they run a little short/narrow (at least for my foot). Also excellent service from the seller.
"I've worn New Balance 608 in several versions for many years. These have the comfort sole insert and are great for walking, biking, working out, all the things I do regularly. My only concern is that 608s may not be around much longer. Hard to find locally. GO AMAZON!"
Very comfortable.  I've worn them for two days on my feet (as in standing and walking) without the usual achy feet from adjusting to new shoes.
"The shoes fit a touch small, but not using them for running, they seem to be fine. He always wears a size 12 and theseseem a touch smaller than a size 12."
Love New Balance shoes because I have very wide feet and they are one of the few manufacturers that offer 4e widths with a wide choice of styles and colors. I was a bit worried about buying shoes online but since I have owned this brand and model more than a few times I took a chance and as always NB didn't disappoint. Excellent product.
"This is a re-order of the same shoe I ordered several years ago. My podiatrist recommends New Balance, so what better reason is there than that?"
"Runs very large, had to go down 1 1/2 sizes to get to normal. The inner liners are removable. They are hard to grasp, but grabbing at the insole they can be removed. They are not glued or attached in anyway. The bottom of the shoe has a blue rubber texture. The insole that come with the shoe are very hard, very thin and stiff about 1/8th inch and do not give at all. I highly recommend you buy a set of third party insoles that can be cut to the pattern of the insoles you remove."
This particular NB shoe has a larger toe than competitive shoes &amp; other NB shoes. I purchased different NB shoes &amp; returned to the 608 style shoe for the comfort.
Edit: Got the regular width this time and they're perfect.  As a postal worker that is on his feet ten hours a day six days a week these are the best shoes I've found yet.  And the price is right.  And if they lasted me six months then they would last someone who doesn't abuse his or her shoes even longer.<br/><br/>These are my first pair of New Balance shoes.  Ordered the wide because I didn't know how they would fit and other brands have been too narrow.  Turns out the wide was too wide and should have gone with the standard medium width.  Lesson learned.  Good news is I love the shoes and will buy again.  As a letter carrier I'm on my feet all day and these are great shoes.  Would recommend to my coworkers.
"These shoes are clearly at the lower end of New Balance's product offerings. I purchased the size 16, a size up from my normal 15 and was surprised that they were smaller than several older pairs of New Balance size 15s I already own. They will be ok for what I want them for, which is to wear during exercise, but I wouldn't have been able to wear a size 15 in this model at all. Also, the sole insert is flat, and I mean ""flat"". It has no discernible arch at all. I substituted a premium replacement insole, which solved the support problem and also helped with the overall length problem by pushing up my arch, effectively ""shortening"" my foot."
"Memory Foam insoles are quite comfortable...Initially, they fit a tad snugly...after four or five wears they are more comfortable.  But next time I'll order a 1/2-size up."
My first pair of these shoes is starting to wear out so it's time for a new pair.  These shoes fit great and are very comfortable walking shoes.
"This particular model shoe, was recommended by my foot doctor as having the proper support for good foot health. I was wearing Sketchers before, but suffered from, Plantar's Facia. The New Balance shoes do not seem to aggravate that condition.They are comfortable and fit well. They do however, have a short life. The last 4 pair, only lasted a year each, before the soles parted from the uppers. It's a great shoe but the workmanship could be a lot better. It would help if they were a bit cheaper, considering that they don't seem to hold up as long as they should."
"I love these shoes because they fit my 4E feet perfectly and are made and wear very well.  I have bought numerous pairs over the years and use them for aerobic workouts, weight training, walking and casual outings."
"I can not give these shoes an informed evaluation, other than the fact that they were too small for me to wear! Since I am required to provide a ""star"" rating, I have given them 4 stars!<br/><br/>I have been wearing New Balance  608's in one version or another, in size 13 4E, for more years than I can remember. They have always been a very comfortable fit from the start. These however were quite tight and seem to be a bit shorter than the older pair I have been wearing. They also seem to be a lot lighter in weight. I ordered one pair in white/navy and another in the brown. I am returning them both and ordering another pair of each in size 14 4E. Hopefully those will fit more comfortably?"
"I purchased these to replace my existing New Balance shoes which were starting to wear out. I compared the model/size/everything to the tag on my current shoes and ordered what I hoped was the exact same shoe I had before. Unfortunately, these were much smaller in the toe width and a big larger in the length than my previous shoes. Apparently size 10 1/2 changes over time for a company. They are still comfortable enough to wear as is but I will probably not be buying another pair of these shoes when I these current ones wear out."
new balance sneakers have been good to me...  untill now. MX208v4 are worse than WallyWorld 10 dollar sneakers. these sorry low grade money grubbing onlt lunk
Love it.
I've wore this model shoe from New Balance for the past year or two and they are by far the most comfortable to wear of all the premium brands.<br/>I very highly recommend this shoe.
Love the memory foam insole! I wore them for 2 months exclusively at the gym. 40 minute workouts. Feet stay comfortable. Would recommend
they fit very well but the problem is that they wear out fast on the inside the memory foam does not hold up well i am hard on sneakers but i have never wore out the inside before the outside very disappointed with thees for the price
"I tried another brand after I couldn't find NB at local stores.  Big mistake.  Came on Amazon and order a few pairs and once again love my shoes.  I wasn't sure on the 2x or 4x wide so defaulted to the 4x and very glad I did.  An incredibly comfortable fit.  The 2x may have worked too but if you're looking for a ""wide"" shoe I'd try the 4x first.  Those seem to fit like the ones I used to buy from the local store.  Anyways a very good product as usual.  Thanks!"
Comfortable and fit well but extremely squeaky!!
You get exactly what you expect from New Balance. I bought these in the 10.5 4E since they didnt have 2E in my size. Little wider then i want but still very comfortable. I stand and walk for 10 hrs a day for work and bought these for comfort for a long day on my feet and they do the job great.<br/><br/>Only downfall is they was out of the color I really liked guess it got (discontinued.)<br/><br/>Overall I highly recommend for anyone who walks or stands alot everyday.
Great shoes.  I add PowerStep inserts to give me additional arch support.  I like these because you can get wide sizes.
"Good Shoe. Have been buying for years.  Fits as expected and is good quality - not great, but good.  Wear them for workouts and for around the house."
Kind of odd.  I originally ordered a size 12.5 Wide.  They were too small.  My Toe was cramped and were uncomfortable.  Therefore I returned them and ordered a size 13 Wide.  These are too big.  Whodathunkit?  I won't be ordering these shoes again.  I'll go back to Nike.
"This shoe are very comfortable, I bought two pair...just in case I can't find them when the pair wears out.  My orthotics fit very nicely in the show also."
I normaly wear new balance size 13 2E but ordered 13 4E.  They took ten days just to ship and arrived two days later.  Tried them on and are 1/2 small.  Thinking of sending them back
