review
I am a big fan of Converse All Stars. I already knew what to expect since I owned 11 pairs before ordering these. Nice thing is one pair of All Stars is going to fit like all others. Once you know your size you can order with confidence. This was the last color I needed to complete the rainbow of Chucks.
"These are not real Converse! I ordered these for my husband and two days after he started wearing them, they started turning white!<br/>We wondered if they were knockoffs, then read some of the reviews on here...and now I know they are. I'm so mad we wasted $60 on these. Too bad I can't give 0 stars."
"I LOVE Chucks. I have about 8 or 9 pairs. They are my go to shoe. I wear them with everything., skirts, dresses, jeans...... I like them because they hold up well and are comfy right out of the box. I also have so knock offs and the are so uncomfortable with thin soles or they are HOT and not in a good way (Sweaty feet). Chucks have those little air holes in the side and believe me it makes a big difference. On my feet all day and when I wear my chucks...no sore feet (or smelly feet)!"
"I love these black leather Chuck's!!!  I have a couple other Chuck's and had been wanting to get the black and white for a while.  I had no idea they came in leather!  It's a great look to a classic shoe.  Looks good with shorts or jeans and with the leather I am sure you could wear them with slacks to spice up your look for a more casual event.  They fit as expected, which is you should know your Converse (at least Chuck's) sizing as they run large."
"Love the shoes. They appear genuine to me, despite other reviews re knock offs, may be hit or miss, not doubting the reviews, I read good and bad before I order. Anywhoo, bought for two sons, both wear mens 9.5 in all other shoe brands. I ordered the unisex 11.5 women/ 9.5 mens, it is easily a true 11.5 mens, not 9.5 mens. Returning two pair and going down two sizes, fingers crossed that the sizing is not corrected and I get true 9.5 size, however listed size appears online."
"This review is for the all-black version, which is the kind of shoe that works with a huge variety of outfits. I've even worn them in more professional contexts where black-and-white (or other colors of) Chucks would be a bit too flashy."
The shoe is more comfortable in the padding for sure...but the stitching still rubs blisters on your heels. Wish they would finally get that corrected. I'm sure they have had many complaints about it over the years. I have to tape my heels everytime I wear them...and then they are ok. They also rub on my little toe where the stitching inside where he rubber meets the material.
Some say these are fake Chucks. I don't believe they are and I seriously doubt converse would allow Amazon to sell fakes. I do however believe the seller is failing to disclose that these are outlet quality shoes. Mine have multiple defects. They do run a half size big which is normal for Chucks. The price was good so I don't so much mind the aesthetic defects as they are small and the shoes wear fine. The seller needs to own up to the quality of shoe they are selling.
"I love these shoes!!!  I've always wanted Pink Converse, and with a trip to New Orleans approaching, I finally purchased a pair.  My feet are narrow, but I found that the pinky toes rubbed against the side of the shoe after a couple hours of wear. No matter. Shoes sometimes do this. I put bandaids on the pinky toes, and went about my walking. I'm sure they'll become more comfortable over time, so I don't mark these as an issue for myself. However, someone with larger and wider feet may have more issues during initial use.<br/><br/>These shoes are cute and appear to be decent quality. I would purchase them again."
"This is a great shoe, I mean great shoe for the gym.  I was amazed how much ""firmer"" and in line my body felt while squatting.  I usually wear 11 1/2 athletic shoes.  The 11 1/2 and the 11 wear both to large for me.  Something to consider before ordering.  May want to try on somewhere in advance.<br/>Can't beat Prime delivery."
I've been wanting a pair of converse forever and finally broke down and bought a pair. I'm so glad I did. They looks great with a skater dress or sweats and a sweatshirt. Very versatile and they even look better as time goes by with a little bit of dirt. I'm a size 7 and pretty narrow foot and they fit great. You can definitely wear them for long hour like during concerts or festivals. Overall a great purchase!
"Fit pretty well, I have some wider feet but these feel comfortable. Accidentally got the completely black ones instead of the black ones w/ the white bottoms...but I like them quite well so I'll keep em like they are, just be careful when ordering to make sure you are choosing the correct color. Think they will last me a while, material feels sturdy and also easy to clean."
"Chuck's are the best; they've been my favorite for 20 years. We purchased the red this last time, which was vibrant and beautiful in color, but the toe-ends of the shoes are narrower than they used to be and hurt my toes (and I have naturally slender, flexible, narrow feet). They also came way too big in size. Something for the company/seller to consider? A great quality in shoes otherwise.<br/>-Love &amp; Rant"
"Great shoes, always have been.  They do run large but converse always have so be careful of that.  The optic white is awesome for personalizing, i buy about 3-5 pairs per month that i draw on and sell and they are always great quality.  Compared to vans however it is a courser canvas so you do have to spray them prior to drawing on them to give a more even surface"
These shoes are awesome! I was so excited to get a pair at such a great deal. Vibrant color (I got the red) and they fit perfectly. Converse is pretty much always in Men's sizing so if you are a woman you have to go down 2 sizes (ex: I am a Women's size 8 so I got a Men's 6). My feet are of normal or medium width so the 6(B)M fit great. Converse makes pretty comfortable shoes so you can wear them all day and they last a very long time if you aren't too crazy and are careful. I get compliments all the time and I love them
I used to order things a half-size down. but these should definitely be ordered a FULL SIZE smaller than your usual size. Especially if you've never worn high-tops before. the canvas fabric stretches and the high-top fit means your feet sit in a slightly different spot in the shoe than the standard low-top fit.
"My daughter loves her Converse! She even washed them to wear them for Prom! She has wide feet and these fit her perfectly. I'm jealous. I remember my teenage years and my hi-top Converse - and I miss them! I need a bit of an arch support these days, but glad she's carrying on the tradition."
"I've worn Chucks for years so I knew what to expect - though I've never owned a pair of pink or pink-like colored shoes in this style. I ordered the Pink Sapphire and double checked my choice - something I always do with these ""multiple choice"" listings.<br/><br/>The shoes arrived rather quickly - however - even before I pulled back the last layer of packaging tissue in the shoe box I could tell they were the wrong color. (Too dark to be pink.) I was sent the Eggplant selection by mistake - or at least I'm hoping that's the case. The colors couldn't be more different. One is supposedly a bright raspberry like pink - while the eggplant is very much the color of the vegetable. A dark rich purple (nearly black in some light.) Luckily I liked the color enough to just keep the shoes. But be mindful when placing your order that you might end up with the ole switch-a-roo pulled on you."
"I got the wrong size for my niece because these shoes are unisex. I was able to return them, BUT I had to pay for shipping which is kind of odd now a days with online sellers. Normally they'll send you a return label but not this seller. So I paid for shipping twice for nothing<br/>Aside from seller problems, I've bought these shoes before and love them. They are true to size so don't go up or down! They're pretty comfy but not a lot of arch support. They look cool too btw!"
"I've had these for almost a year and they are just now starting to wear out. I wear them everyday at work where I am walking on them for 8hoirs straight, 40 hrs a week. Converse are a favorite of mine. I must say that if you are a size 9.5 or 8.5 get the next size up as converse do not sell in half sizes and the size below will be much too small for you. So if you're a 9.5, get a 10. It will fit fine and won't rub your foot raw."
"Received them today on time. Correct item. I had to email the seller due to an incorrect photo in the your orders tab  and they replied in literally five minutes! They fit exactly as all my other pairs do. I paid slightly less than I would have at finish line for a pair. I don't think they are seconds. I will leave response on wear. The tag in the tongue differs as to country of origin.Other than that- feet feeling good. ðŸ˜€ I've been on them all day and they fit fine. Very,very happy. Would order again. Thanks, Millikix!"
Great shoes. I had no problems with the sizing.
"They fit exactly how I expect Converse to fit. Narrow and no arch support. I bought size 4.5, which is a 6.5 in womens, and it fits with another i 3-4 cm at the toe. It's supposed to be that way, unless the top of your foot is a point.<br/><br/>I bought my shows from Dynamic Sneakers. I'm pretty wary of buying shoes online, since there are a lot of knock offs, especially on Chucks.<br/>I've checked my shoes and they seem to be genuine. If they aren't, they're a pretty good knock-off , so I don't really care."
Can't go wrong with the classic white converse. Very durable and comfy. A lot lighter than vans because the sole is thinner so if you like light shoes these will do. Soles are a little thin but are still comfortable for every day use. White will get dirty so keep that in mind when you wear them.
"I've had Converse All Stars most of my life.  They never seem to change, or at least, not much.  The reds have always been my favorite.  They always seem to fit as expected.  Just order 1/2 side smaller and they're perfect.  Maybe they should just go ahead and change their sizing since the 1/2 side smaller than shown is consistent.  Just remember, they on't go in the washer.  Hand wash only or they rubber parts will start to separate.  Other than that, they're pretty much indestructible."
"I don't really feel these run that big, maybe a half a size bigger but in the summer when your feet swell from the heat I think your better off staying with your normal size but that's just my opinion.  I love the light pool blue color I got and got many compliments when I wear them.  I mostly wear them with jeans or leggings."
"I love my white converse!  I wish I could keep them as white as when they aree brand new but after a few months I just break down and buy a new pair.  Overall they are great shoes and I never have issues with the rubber coming off or anything.  Even though they say 'Mens' they are for both men and women.  I don't have any issues wearing them all day, they're comfortable and cute!"
"I love my Chucks! These I bought for my Doctor Who Halloween Cosplay costume, (I'm gender-bending the 10th Doctor, my favorite!), but will wear them often. I also have a black pair, a purple patterned pair and an embroidered dragons pair. Next, I'll get a red pair, but I have to save up. I had to wear heels and a suit all of my working life, but as a retired, more (ahem) mature lady, I'm now gonna wear whatever the heck I want to! I really love Chucks and other fun, comy shoes!"
So happy that Chucks have made a come back.  Both my girls wear Converse to school and black is a staple in their wardrobe.  They have both the high tops and the low ones.  I love the different colors that are available for Chucks and I know my daughters will be wearing them for years to come.
"The only shoe my 16-year old will wear. Finding black  on black hi-tops can be difficult, finding them in his size can be a nightmare. I was both excited and thankful when I found them on Amazon and for less than the local mall prices. They arrived quickly and put a smile on my son's face! Thank you."
"I love these shoes. Been wearing them since I was in high school. Now that I'm older I can't wear flat shoes for long periods of time without get a little back pain. So I buy these ""Pedag Step 166475 Symmetrical Self Adhesive Arch Support Inserts, Black Leather, Medium"" everytime I get a new pair of converse. I always buy a half size smaller. I'm usually a 9 but 8 1/2 fits much better."
"It's hard for me to find the right size shoe, and I always have to go one size up to accomodate width. Lots of colour/pattern options. Converse feel different since buying them in middle/high school, but companies change and I understand.<br/><br/>I bought the dusky pink ones (don't remember the actual colour name) and while they look cute, the colour barely survived a single 3rd shift. It faded pretty quickly, but I don't mind it much. These work as both a fashion statement and a reliable pair of shoes."
Navy Blue<br/>I've worn these every day since I've received them. Even though I ordered a size down as many reviewers suggested these were still about a half size too large. I figure that eventually they'll shrink some in the wash. I plan on getting two more pairs and I'll either order just a little bit smaller or see how how much these shrink after being washed. My biggest problem is what colors to choose as there are so many!
"Very stylish shoe. I opted out to buy them online, however you can find them at retailers. I opted to purchase them online because I found that they tended to be a few dollars cheaper and were prime eligible. I would recommend to find your fit beforehand in a store, and then proceed to order online off of Amazon. My last pair lasted for around 2 years with everyday use, which is very good IMO. I am quite happy with this purchase."
"Needed them for my brother's wedding because for some reason some people think Converse go with tuxes and I had no say in the matter so I shut up and did as I was told.  Can't complain, though--I still wear them, and though they felt a tad big at first after breaking them in they feel fine."
"I love this shoe. It reminds me of the pair I had when I was a kid. They are not the most comfortable shoe (my reason for 4 stars instead of 5), but let's be honest, I didn't get them for comfort. I got them, because of the stylel. I did have to exchange them the first time to get a smaller size. If you have never purchased Chuck's before, then I suggest going to a store to find out your size before ordering. I purchase 1/2 size smaller than my normal size. Buy them! You'll love wearing them."
"Perfect fit and come as advertised, they're the real deal. That said, these will KILL YOUR FEET. I, personally, do not find these comfortable for more than an hour. They are completely flat inside, no arch support whatsoever--and there is very little padding. My rating is still 4-stars because of the things I don't like are basically as this shoe should be. They are and old, timeless, design I still see people young and old gravitating to even today. If you like 'em, get 'em. Just know what they are."
"Converse shoes aren't light nor provide good support, but they're not athletic shoes and people buy them mostly for design. If you have the right expectations these are very nice &amp; cute sneakers that go with pretty much anything you wear in daily life.  Just a little note on sizing: I normally wear women's 8, ordered unisex 6, it's close to half a size bigger. I wear thick socks with them anyway and tie the strings high up so they work just fine, but just be aware."
"I do love these shoes, but they have taken much longer to break in than any other Chucks I've ever owned (which are many). I got these in my regular size and they fit pretty well everywhere but the heel. I got some pretty gnarly blisters, because I wore them too long and walked too much. Ah well. Overall I really like them. Black on black goes with EVERYTHING. I just wish they weren't so stiff."
"I'm accustomed to Dansko, Sanita, and Allegria shoes, which are all very comfortable, but require a break in period. I'm ok with that. But these never seemed to get broken in. Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands. I'm on my feet 9 hours a day, on concrete, walking around and up and down stairs, for several miles a day, sometimes with long periods standing (I'm an adult-education instructor). I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time, and was hoping these would be it. I wear a 10 (40) in women's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well (thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order) but they just aren't the shoe for me."
"The firm, minimally padded soles make these great weightlifting shoes. You will have solid support and a solid base for lifting things and putting them down.<br/><br/>At the same time, the firm soles and lack of any real support make them lousy for walking a lot, let alone running. They seem a bit overpriced for such a basic shoe, but I don't know of a cheaper alternative.<br/><br/>That said, they do have a unique look. I originally bought mine for a vintage costume party, and only later found that they are great for lifting."
"I was having a conversation with a friend... we were discussing wearing Cons since we were kids many years ago.  I can't imagine any other style of shoe will have the longevity these have since the style hasn't changed since inception.  The all blacks are great looking and they fit to size.  The cost was the same the black and whites, so these are a good purchase at the price point.  If you want to be really kind to your feet, purchase a pair of Scholl's insoles for arch support and you'll have a great pair of all arounds for the warmer months."
"I purchased this as a cosplay accessory for Saint Seiya's Seiya in casual clothes and was very pleased with then once I opened them and my boyfriend tried it on! They fit great, held up great, and look even better, and needless to say, my his cosplay looked great too! Haha. =]"
I was nervous about purchasing these because the reviews vary so much. I gave 5 stars because my shoes are everything that I expect from the converse brand. To help others.... I am a true to size 7.5 in women's shoes.  I purchased men size 5/ women's size 7. I did this because they run a half size big. They are still roomy but NOT enough for me to say a full size bigger.
"Totally bought these for my Doctor Who outfit.  I'm a girl, btw!  These fit great.  They give you extra room and I love that.  There is a lot of walking around when you go to cons so I needed something that wouldn't kill my feet.  I am a size 10 and I got a size 8 in Mens.  I have a wide foot and for sneakers, normally have to go a half or full size up for room/comfort.  I did research before buying these...Converse shoes always run big.  So, for me, it fit as expected because I did my research!  But in general, they run big.<br/><br/>CON: There is no arch support.  I bought these arch cushion things and that fixed the problem."
"I just received these shoes this morning, and I'm impressed like usual. This is my second pair of Chucks, my first pair were low tops, these are high tops. The red color is nice and vibrant, and the white on the shoe has a very clean look. I ordered half a size up from my last pair and they seem to be the same size, but it works. They are about two inches longer than my feet, but I hardly notice. They can be rather painful if you wear them ALL day before you break them in, and even after you break them in if you wear them for am extremely long time due to them having almost ANY arch support whatsoever.  All in all these are very good shoes; ONCE you break them in to fit your foot shape a little better."
"I'm overjoyed with my purchase. These lovelies came a day ahead of schedule and fit beautifully. They're authentic and look even better in person. I usually bought Converse Chuck Taylors at the Slauson Supermall (swapmeet) here in Los Angeles, California. I took a leap of faith with Amazon and I am totally won over! Not only do I love the uniqueness of this particular style, but it fits much better. The usual stiffness and flatness is absent from this Chuck Taylor, and they don't chafe my tender skin. I'm extremely satisfied to say the least. I highly recommend this seller!"
"Bought a ""very good condition"" used pair from the warehouse deals; when I received the shoes, their condition was like new. I normally wear size 8 (women's), but having owned a pair of Converse Chucks before, I knew that they tend to run about a half-size larger. I ordered a 7.5, and length-wise, they fit perfectly. My feet are slightly wider than most girls' feet, so they're a little tight on my pinky toes. I've worn them about a week, and they're getting more comfortable now. White Chucks match with almost any outfit, so I'm really happy with these."
"I ordered a size 9.5 in men's because that is the size of my work shoes. However, this is over an inch longer than the length of my feet. These are expensive and I'm using them for a cosplay for one day so I don't really feel like returning them but I wish I had got a different size."
Bought these for my son. They fit great and he loves them. They have held up well. Can't expect much more than that for a shoe.
"The shoes themselves are fine, if maybe a bit large, however the color is nothing like the image at all. Rather than the strictly average looking orange that the image depicts these shoes were practically glowing when I took them out of the box. Imagine the most neon orange you've ever seen and then amplify that at least twice. These shoes are positively radioactive. In my short experience with them they're extremely distracting and difficult to match with an outfit. If I'd wanted that these would have been great, but I wanted shoes that looked like the picture and those are not what I got."
"After reading some of the horrific reviews relating to genuineness and specifically sizing I just ordered my regular size which is a men's 9 medium. They fit me perfectly! Are a little bit roomy  but not too loose even when I wear them without socks. Many reviews questioned whether these were genuine or counterfeit. The pair I received  is definitely Genuine  and appeared to be first quality where ever they are made. Maybe the bad experiences are because people ordered from third parties rather than having Amazon  for fill the order. Long story short they are true to size, are genuine, and our first quality.  step up to the plate and order your own size rather than gHess!"
"My 12 year old daughter had to have these shoes for school.  I gave in and although she liked them, I thought they were a big on the big side in length and width.  Cute shoe but the fit was ok."
"Great style terrible quality.<br/><br/>After the 4th time wearing them, the glue where the shoe bends (ball of the foot) has separated. It's been getting progressively worse. While converse have never been the most comfortable shoe, in my opinion, these are little more than hard rubber, glue and cheap canvas."
"I like the shoe but I should have gone 1 1/2 size smaller. I normally wear size 12 in just about every other shoe I own except for Chuck Taylors. These fit ok with regular socks but I usually wear these with thin or no socks. Bottom Line I am a 12 in all other shoes (New Balance Minimus with no socks) and I should have gone with 10 1/2. I actually now have 2 other CT's, the leather city hikers and a leather low, both 10.5 and both fit perfectly."
"Classic Converse fit, these shoes are slightly larger than average in length yet also a bit narrower. They have little arch support but you can fix that with inserts. They're exactly what you expect from Converse.<br/>These look somewhat blue in the photo (to me) but they're stark black with the rubber/natural soles. Great look. Bought several pairs for wedding party."
"Fit was as expected size-wise, but the cut was a bit awkward. After wearing for a day they seemed to break in, however. Love the width between lace holes because it is more flattering to a narrow foot. Price is a bit high, but you are going to pay big bucks anywhere for authentic Converse Chuck Taylors."
"I got these for my daughter,she had been eyeballing them for a while.Every time we went to the mall she would ask for them,so I checked Amazon.As expected,they had them and at a lower price,which is why I shop here.Got them a few days later and everyone is happy now."
"I've always loved converse and this time is no exception. They take a couple months of wearing before your feet become accustomed to them, mine were extremely tight through the toes at first but now they're just dandy :)<br/><br/>Update: They kill my feet. I tried inserts but these have become unwearable. Really disappointed. They get more uncomfortable the more I wear them."
"I've worn these shoes in one color or another for many years. I keep coming back to them. They hold up remarkably well (and I'm quite hard on apparel and shoes), always get positive comments, and feel almost like not wearing shoes.<br/><br/>Likes: Appearance, washability, cost. Your heel makes a squeaking sound when you walk. Goes with anything from jeans and a t-shirt, to shorts, or vested suits.<br/><br/>Dislikes: They smell a little funny for the first few days. Your heel makes a squeaking sound when you walk.<br/><br/>A word of warning: If you're on your feet for long periods of time your feet will probably hurt unless you've built up to it; they have no support.<br/><br/>Recommended to anyone with a spunky outlook on life."
I ordered these shoes for my 5 month old son. I ordered a size 2 and they fit him very well. My sons feet are so chubby so they were a little hard to get all the way on being that they are high tops. Still they were beyond adorable on my baby boy. They shipped fast and were packaged well. We love Convere and will be ordering more.
"I have been a fan of Converse Chuck Taylors since middle school (I am now 23 for reference), and whenever I have to buy a new pair I am never disappointed. They are a great every day sneaker and have a classic look to them, that never gets old. Once you wear them for a while, they will become one of the comfiest pairs of shoes you will buy. They are a flat sole shoe, so do not expect great arch support from them, but I can wear them all day and feel great by the end of the day."
"I ordered the all white leather converse in size 10 women/8 mens. The reason why I'm giving the product 2 stars is because they fit too big! :( I have skinny narrow feet, Idk what to do they were expensive to begin with so I probably won't go through the hassle of returning them. I'm 5'8 so I'll just try to pull them off either way UGH MAN I wanna say size down but what if they're too small?? I'm going to go buy fat socks now... :("
"Converse are always nice shoes and hold up better than any other brand. This burgundy color was perfect, but I feel the Unisex shoe just looks like a man's shoe. The toe is more pointed perhaps? I measured my foot, went down a size, tried some on in a store, and then ordered the equivalent in men's as it instructed, and they were STILL too big. :-( I'm going to return them and am reluctant to just get a size down... I'm wondering if I should search for women's styles to get exactly what I wanted..."
"I would order a full size down from the size shoe that is normally worn. I've been ordering chucks for many many years now, so I always know what to expect ordering both my children and myself converse. They hold up extremely well to my autistic son who tends to drag his feet all over."
"They are very narrow and very very squeaky.  Not good for Ninjas, that's for sure."
Have to say I am fairly impressed love the leather look much better than the canvas. 1 of 3 pairs of converse i own The shoes have held up for a few years now may need replacing soon but over time thats expected for any shoe good price stylish and amazon always has my size not common in the stores
"High quality materials and workmanship. Does not feel ""cheap"" at all. Classic style. Exactly what I was looking for.  (I don't use/need arch support, so I don't care about that.) I do wish they made a Wide version in women's, but I've never seen them in Wide before, so these were exactly what I expected. I'll just have to break them in."
"This shoe looks cool, most have seen it either personally or on TV. But, that's about it. There is hardly any sole support and after a while the very firm base makes one feel like they are walking almost barefoot. If you have a lot of shoes and especially some good ones with maybe memory foam or gel insoles and tend to walk a lot, I think you will find yourself tending to want to wear something more comfortable. On looks and cool factor though, this shoe nails it."
"I love these shoes! Over the past year I have purchased Asics, Nikes, and other ""supposedly"" good support shoes and when I bought these ""Converse"" I was buying them for the look and style, only to fall in love with how comfortable and cute they are .... I used these to walk everywhere! I am so glad I bought these. Now I have to find some green ones. I hope this review helps someone."
"These run in mens sizes. If you order your correct mens size you'll get a pair that fits. Also always size down in chucks, I wear an 8.5 and in chucks I wear a 7. They just run huge, they always have. Check up on them in a sneaker store first to get your correct size.<br/>They are standard canvas chucks. No support inside, if you need it toss in some. The white is classic, super bright, dig them so much."
"Cute sneakers but there is no arch support whatsoever, and I knew that before purchasing. That's why I'll only wear them for a few hours here and there. I'm sure it would be easy enough to add some sort of foot-liner-thingie in there without a problem ;) I normally take a 7 in womens, and I also knew to go down a 1/2 size as it says on the Converse website. So a 6 1/2 became a 4 1/2 in mens - they're a little big on me and if I had to buy again, I would go for a size 4 instead. Very cute though ;)"
"Converse are too classic not to have in your collection. Black low top Converse is what I wore home from the hospital when I was born, and I've bought a fresh pair every 2-4 years since then. Like every pair I've owned this purchase didn't disappoint. I typically wear a size 6-6.5 and 4 always fits me perfectly."
"These are shoes are comfy and an excellent choice ofvyou have feet that are hard to fit. Stylish and a beloved classic, not alot competes with the chuck taylor design. However for the price I feel the shoes should be held to a higher standard of quality. For instance, why bother printing any amount of text or brand logo on the heel when it just seems to erode from mundane daily use? The laces are just to long, the soles quickly wear down, and the over all fit and finish is disapointing."
"We purchased 8 pairs of these for our wedding for the groom and groomsmen to wear. All arrived quickly and fit perfectly. The guys were stoked to wear these instead of stuffy old dress shoes, and they looked great with the charcoal gray tuxes. Another wedding was going on at the same time at our venue, and the groom and groomsmen of that wedding said they were jealous that they didn't get to wear these! The best part is, the guys all have a classic pair of chucks to wear in daily life now. My husband pretty much lives in his, and I want a pair for myself."
Purchased these for my granddaughters husband because he really needed a new pair of shoes. The fit was great and they are holding up very well. I read some comments about sizes and quality not being what it should be but so far not a problem at all and he loves them! Most important part of the whole transaction.
"These are really just a cool sneaker that is a Nostalgia thing really, They feel like they did in the late 60's and 70's! They look cool and have no support whatsoever! That's alright they never did! If your looking for support and arch protection and comfort than go get some New Balance or Nike sneakers. But These are what they are! Cool looking blast from the past."
"These shoes came quickly, seem to be the real thing, or at the very least an impeccable imposter. With any pair of converse, they start to hurt your feet after a while and do not really supply any type of arch support. I wear these shoes often to work, and they have been holding up so far! The stitch work and the overall make of the shoe is spot on."
"These shoes have no arch support.  They have no real padding.  The sizing is weird.  I finally got to my right size by the help I got from other buyers who left reviews.  All in all...not the greatest shoes at all.  HOWEVER, they are just so darn cute!!!  And I'm not even sure WHY I think they're so cute...but they just do it for me.  Youthfulness, I suppose!  So, about the sizing...I sized down from my normal size 8 to a 7 and that was too tight.  I returned them.  Then I ordered a 7-1/2 from a different seller and they worked great.  They're fun to wear."
"I wanted a pair of Chucks for a long time, and finally splurged and bought these. I tried them on at a brick and mortar store before purchasing them online, and I am glad I did. I wear an 8.5 in women's, so I usually order a 6.5 in men's...in these, I ordered an 8 women's/6 men's and they fit perfectly. They aren't walking shoes, but they are comfortable enough for wearing several hours and they look great."
"They fit better than I thought, but I have a high arch and a narrow foot. I cant wear them all day, but 6 hours is fine.<br/>I haven't worn them since high school (25 years ago) and they are just as cool now as then."
"My son loves Converse but when we ordered this item we received a plain gray high top (rather than the shoe displayed with gray strips and stars on the tongue and tack decoration).  We kept it because my son still liked them, but this isn't what we expected based on the picture."
"My first pair of Chucks - in the color I wanted (that is somewhat hard to find) - Beach Glass!  I don't know why some people think this is Tiffany Blue - it's not. It's just a light aqua green on the verge of mint.  Tiffany Blue has a little more blue to it.  Comfy - I sized down, as suggested."
"Bought it in men size, and is a legit pair of converse. If you have wore Converse before, it is as expected. The only weird part of the product I received is that the color of the rubber toe cap is much darker than as pictured. However, I don't have any complain, it is still a pair of converse. No arch support as any usual converse."
"I love these shoes. I bought a pair a few years back. They lasted me three years before I had to replace them with the pair I recently bought. Love this brand. They last. I work retail and am always running from one end of the store and back again (I seriously take about 10,000 steps just during a four hour shift). I wear these all the time-- at work, outside, running errands, everywhere. They last a long time and I highly recommend them."
"I would have given 5 stars, but they were a bit big. I ordered a women's 7.5, but they fit more like an 8.5.  However, I'm still able to wear them and they are comfy."
"love it love it! I own couple pairs of Converse already - but depends of style ( man sizing, universe sizing or woman sizing) i wear different size. I got 7.5 and it fits perfect, ussually I wear 8 woman. They are also not very narrow so my feet feels very comfortable."
"I am currently a theater student and needed a pair of solid black shoes to wear when I'm working as part of the tech crew. Typically I wear a pair of beat up black work boots, which are fine during the week prior to opening when there is still construction going on and I need more protection for my feet. I wanted something black, supportive, and that wasn't going to leave me wanting to chop my feet off at the end of the day. Tech theater often involves a lot of standing. I took these out and road-tested them for opening last Saturday and was not disappointed. They were quiet, a must when running around backstage, feel solid on my feet, and I was pain-free at the end of the day. It's been a long time since I've worn converse, but now I'm in the market for a few more pairs for every day use."
"Remember to always order a # smaller than what you currently wear, these run on the larger side. If you have to stand all day I would not recommend wearing these. The sole is hard and offers very little support, they look great but after a few hours of standing your feet will feel miserable. The print on the back of the shoe is starting to wear off, i usually wear them once or twice a week. The plastic on the side where the foot bends hasn't broken, it's warped from the way the shoe bends but it's still intact. This is my 2rd pair of All stars and i'm very happy with them. I use them to deadlift or squat regularly and they offer great support."
"I put inserts in these shoes and wore them walking all over Boston with no issues. Super cute and they helped me average about 11 miles a day with no pain. Again, I put inserts in mine but I wanted comfortable shoes that were also cute and didn't look like old lady shoes."
They're Converse. Do I really need to say more? They are a classic.<br/>These were purchased for my 14 yr old daughter who loves them and wears them constantly.<br/>I will say from experience that I wouldn't recommend them for someone older than 30. I had a pair around that age and the lack of arch support means that you can only wear them for a short period of time before your feet begin to ache something fierce.
"I one day got tired of shoes not fitting my feet the way I liked... I only buy three brands of footwear adidas, converse (usually chuck taylors) and timberlands. This is the second pair of all black all leather chucks I have owned. My previous pair have finally worn out after 4 years thats right FOUR YEARS and guess what they are still wearable and still look good but the soles are shot. These are simply put the the most simple, durable classic shoes EVER. You can have your fancy jordans, or nikes... You will be buying a new pair within six months or so.. Chuck Taylors last A LIFE TIME. However my previous pair were half a size too bug so I went with a ten on these, and it was perfection. These like I said are the only other sneakers I will buy except certain types of adidas.  So like I said keep al your fancy schmancy shoes/sneakers Chucks are the awesome and durable. Thing is is good luck finding all leather and all black in stores I guess people would rather have form than function... Chucks got it all"
"I love Converse shoes. If only the product info was more accurate, like the size. Sadly, these had to go back due to UK sizing which is quite a bit larger than US sizing, at least one size. Hopefully me experience helps someone else make a correct choice."
"Shipping was VERY fast, they even came in a day earlier than the estimated delivery date. I ordered these converse in Beach Glass and the color is wonderful! Depending on the lighting it can look like a very soft blue or a mint green which I think is really cool. In converse you usually need to order a whole size down but in my case I only needed a half size down. If you're worried about ordering the wrong size just do what I did before you order. I went to a Macy's (because they are one of the VERY few places that carry half sizes in converse but have a pretty limited color selection) and tried on different sizes until I found the one that fit most comfortably. I normally wear a size 8 in pretty much all shoes however in converse I wear a 7.5. Once you figure out what size you are take note and come back here so you can have a wide selection of colors to choose from and half sizes if needed! Overall great product and fantastic delivery time!"
"Come on, classic Converse, how can they go wrong???!!!  Super comfy, always look great with shorts / jeans/ leggings. However, note that they are somewhat narrow, so if you have very wide feet, they will fit more on the snug side. I've had many pairs of these same sneakers over the years... they last and last. They hold up well if you machine wash regularly like I do. And they are affordable enough to replace 2-3 times per year."
"I saw reviews saying these were knock-offs after I already bought them and I was worried they'd fall apart like what seems to happen to other customers. I have to say though, these are really good knock-offs at that, well constructed and look exactly the same except for a few tell-tale signs (namely the lack of tm on the logo).<br/>I wear these all the time, they're my casual shoe of choice. I'm not afraid to walk in dirt/ gravel and these babies are hanging in there about the same as real converse. They fit the same and for the most part feel the same.<br/>I can't justify the price because it's still too pricey for fake converse; if you're a real stickler for quality and label you should probably buy direct from their website to avoid knock-offs. But as far as fakes go, I'm pleasantly surprised by these. Plus shipping was fast."
"Well, I ordered the wrong size by accident (8M - men's shoes, instead of women's shoes), so, they were a couple sizes too big for me. However, they fit my mum perfectly, and she likes them, so, no complaints. :) I love Converse shoes, but I think, next time, I'm going to go to a store and try them on first. For those who know their shoe size beyond any shadow of a doubt and know how to pick it out in a drop-down menu, these shoes are great! For those who are mystified by shoe sizes, you might want to do some research before ordering them online. All in all, the mistake is my own. At any rate, great shoes!"
"If you have bought comverse before then you know they all run small. Other reviews have complained about how its a whole size smaller than what they are normally, but thats how all comverse shoes run. Ive been buying them for years so I knew to get an 8 instead of a 9(my normal size) for these shoes. This was my first time ordering converse off amazon and i will continue to buy them from amazon from now on. They got here fast and I wear them all the time. Just remember to order a size smaller than your normal size and youll be fine."
"THIS ISN'T THE SHOE IN THE PRODUCT PICTURE!!!!!<br/>The shoe is perfect. The only complaint I have is for the actual seller....<br/>The texture shown in the picture appears to be leather, which was the ONLY reason I made my purchase. I needed them for a special occasion. Unfortunately I won't be able to get a replacement in time, so I'll keep these ones. PLEASE USE AN ACCURATE PICTURE!!! It's upsetting and misleading."
"I love these shoes, but give 3 stars because the sizing stinks! Even with the Converse disclosed ""these run 1/2 size large"" they are still TOO BIG! I am a woman's 7 and with the theory of 1/2 size should have ordered the 4.5 - ordered them and they were 1/2 size (at least) too big.  Returned and am currently awaiting my 4's.  I have an old pair of all white's but couldn't find them when I originally ordered to know the appropriate sizing and they are 4's and fit great, and I can wear with or without socks easily.  So LADIES - beware, Men's sizing and I would go a whole size smaller!"
"I remember these shoes from childhood.  I have a pair in blue that are 1/2t size larger. A little too long for me.  So, I purchased these 1/2 size down.  The length is perfect, but the width is a little too narrow for me to frolick for very long.  Too bad - I'd love to wear them all day, but can really only get about a couple of hours."
"They fit as expected. I have a wide foot and can wear between a 10 to 11 in women's. I bought these in a men's 9 &amp; I they fit comfortably. They look super cute with leggings and joggers. Also I LOVE the fabric because it's so easy to maintain and clean! You don't have to put them in the was like regular chucks. You can just use a mild soap and rag and it cleans them up well. These are actually my second pair of the same shoe I ordered from Amazon, only the first pair are white. I've had no problems with them breaking down or fading or turning other colors. However, I do not wear them every day... probably more like 2 to 3 times a week."
"These fit as expected and are wonderful shoes. Why 4 stars? Converse typically have removable insoles, this is great because on these old school Chucks the insole is thin and flat, no support. This style does not have removable insoles. So, my inserts will not work in them."
"Great shoes and they fit a lot of occasions. They can dress up shorts or dress down jeans. Mighty comfortable too. Only problem is sizing. My shoe size varies from 11.5 to 12.5. I bought a pair of 12. They are WAY too large. 11 would be a good fit, a size I never have had.<br/>In short: Order a size or half down."
"Got these for my teenage son. He loves them. They also fit him true to size but I wouldn't say that would be the case for everyone.<br/><br/>I plan to get a pair for myself; just so many styles and colours to choose from. I've never had a pair of Chuck Taylor's or Converse but I really like to see them on other people, so I'm getting myself a pair for  a trial run."
"These shoes were perfect for my Tina Belcher costume!  I wore them out to a bar crawl and dancing and they were super comfortable all night (although I may have been feeling no pain at one point anyway LOL).  I would recommend these for anyone wanting to pull off a Tina costume, or for anyone who just wants to wear high tops."
"After a year I've had to throw these out. Completely my fault though. They just got dirty and I've cleaned them too many times. Using just a toothbrush and soap/water I pulled multiple metal grommets out of their respective holes. The white canvas ones are awesome, but I'd spring for a pair in leather so they don't get ruined when you get them dirty."
"I love Converse and have worn them since I was younger. If you regularly purchase Converse shoes, you KNOW your size and these fit perfectly. Authentic, good thread work, and the soles are PADDED! Very comfortable shoes, I love them!"
"I bought these for extra super critical 15 year old daughter. I mean, she's critical of everything, things she doesn't even understand she willingly passes judgement like some raging queen from the dark ages. That being said, she loves these shoes. It's pretty much the only sneaker she'll wear now. Personally I think they are a little overpriced for what you get, but evidently they are wicked cool."
"I normally wear a size 12-13 in most shoes.  I ordered an 11.5 because I know Chucks generally run large (I have another pair of size 12 high-tops and they fit well, if perhaps slightly too long).  However, I might have to wear a size 10.5 in these low tops.  I believe that sizing variance is a bit silly.<br/><br/>I returned the shoes and did not try another size.  Perhaps some day in the future I will, but to be off that much is ridiculous.  I am very satisfied with my other size 12 Chucks, but evidently there is no standardization in Chuck Taylor shoe sizes."
"My daughter still loves Chuck Taylor's.  She had worn out her last black pair so I got her a navy pair for her birthday.  Chucks are not fancy but they are ok if you like the nostalgia factor.  My dad played high school basketball in those shoes and said they were a great improvement over what they'd had to play in before.  If you like the style, they're pretty durable; and although I think the whole line is a little over priced, I have two pairs myself."
"The toes are a bit narrow, but other than that they fit well! Thus far they have survived multiple festivals and bar crawls. I just throw them in the washer when they get too dirty. The black has faded very slightly, but all of the rubber sole is still intact."
"Exactly what I wanted. Authentic, mint condition, black leather converse. I'm normally a size 9.5 but I'm an 8.5 in converse. Comes"
I needed a hi top shoe to help support a weak ankle and my current tennis shoe was to low and so tight that the ankle brace that I needed would cause my foot to ache. These shoes allowed the brace to fit and gave added support up  high so a perfect solution. .
"These shoes fit as expected. My 7 year old and my 10 year old got a pair. My 10 year old boy wasnt excited about having to tie them but really thought they were cool when we got them. My 7 year old has Down syndrome and likes to take her shoes off all the time. These she could not... yay me! Also, in my opinion, they are really cute on any kid, but especially mine."
"I absolutely love these. The fit is perfect and they look great. As always, they are super comfortable too!!"
"My daughter loves these and when I asked her for feedback for this review she said "" they are perfect"".  I didn't get a half size larger like some commented.  I just ordered her normal women's size and we had no problems.  They even shipped early and made it in before Christmas."
"My son has worn Converse for years, so we expected ZERO arch support or comfort without good quality support/cushion orthotic inserts.  No problem.<br/><br/>But for what ever reason, this pair is NOT holding up well.  After 4 months of use, the fabric has torn away from the outside top edge of the white rubber sole in several spots - not come unglued, (which we might e able to fix) but actually torn.<br/><br/>His other pairs of Converse each lasted a year or more until the bottom soles wore out - which is as expected."
"It's a pair of chucks.<br/><br/>Pros: Looks great, easy to clean and last a long time if you're okay with them looking a bit beat up eventually<br/>Cons: Pretty much just a flat slab of rubber with canvas glued to it. Without a Dr Schoals (sp?) shoe insert, your knees, hips, and back will pay if you plan to do any real walking or prolonged standing. With an insert they're great though."
"What can I say?  No arch support, thin sole, and just the way I like it.  Sizes run a size or so large so order at least a size smaller.  They look good with everything, and you will probably get complements from other chuck cult members when walking down the street.  Great for casual wear, weight lifting, running and sports.  Close to barefoot without any of that extra grip and padding that other ""sport/running"" shoes force on you."
"Classic Converse that will never go out of style. I wear a 6.5 in women's and got the size 6, they fit just fine.  If you are a half size, you'd probably be fine really either way, just depends on your preference.  I'd rather my shoes be a tiny bit smaller than I prefer than too big."
"Love, love these! Excellent prize and very fast shipping.  Bought a second pair I loved them so much.  They do fit slightly bigger than my other Converse.  I usually wear an 8 women's (6 men's) and these are a tad larger than the others, but not large enough to go down a size."
"These fit as expected ( a little big) as i am usually an 11-11 1/2 and i ordered a size 12 (as that was the nearest to my size that were in stock). There is a little extra room in my toe area but i actually prefer a more roomy shoe. I purchased Sof Sole inserts for these as Chucks provide zero arch support and cushion. with the insoles i feel as though the shoe actually fits perfectly. These seem to run pretty true to size even though other reviews say they run big. if you plan on putting a good,solid pair of insoles in for added support then i would go up a half size or so just to be certain."
"These fit exactly as expected and are (fortunately, still) made to last. I am writing this review well over a year after receiving these, and they are still going strong. The only wear-and-tear I believe you can expect with regular use (from my personal experience) is that the black paint on the lace grommets will wear off over time and appear silver underneath, but even with this, I have no complaints. This long-time Converse fan remains a fan!"
"I love the look of converse, so I decided to splurge on a red pair. I love the look, the quality is very good.  They are a little narrow, as most converse all, it was not a problem for me, but something to consider for those that have a wider foot.  The color is a very vibrant red color."
Shoes were great and in good condition. I just made a mistake and ordered the wrong size. I wear a 10 1/12 men's in Pretty much every brand. Ended up settling with a 9 for a good fit converse. Guess everyone's foot is different the half a size smaller wasn't good for me.
"i am on my 2nd pair of converse monochromes and these are the only shoes i wear and will ever wear.  I wear them with jeans, i wear them with black slacks, i wear them playing basketball, etc. etc. etc. They look awesome, they are super comfortable, they don't get dirty and they last about 2 years with every day wear.  I threw my last pair away because i kept wearing them even though they had holes in them because i liked them so much.  Pretty much if i could buy a subscription to shoes where they would send me a new pair every year I would probably do it and then just never have to worry about footwear again.<br/><br/>Actually, this is a good idea - converse send me a pair every year please"
"Well-fitting men's sized shoes for my wide toe base woman's foot.  VERY comfortable, styling is great, and the colour combo of blacks looks modern and classic at the same time.  Bought these as a replacement for a twenty-year old (or more) pair.  Glad that the quality seems to have stayed the same."
"True to size. Very adorable low-top shoe. Only taking away a star because mine arrived with an annoying (permanent) smudge on the toe that ruins the otherwise flawless ""new shoe"" look. Low priority, I know.. but I paid for brand new shoes and I prefer if the makers had upped their quality check a tad."
"The shoes are about a 1/2 size large, but I can live with that. The cloth material is thinner than I remember the original being, but that's a looong time ago. Delivery was when expected. I never dealt w/the Company I purchased from. Still not a bad value and a retro look for $44 delivered."
"This is one of my favorite brand of shoe.  It fit perfect(for me that is).  The color(white) look but better than any other color, but that is just my 2 cents.  Don't really have much to say, but that it is one of those shoe that you will not get tired from wearing it."
I have this style from like 8 years ago and i have a size 10.  i bought these in a ten and they are a bit big but not so much that they flop or that i will bother to return.  they are also a bit more orangey than pictured but i will work it out.
"My kid loves this sneakers, she wears them everyday. Being young her feet haven't got the trouble that comes along with age. As long as these sneakers are only worn for walking and other appropriate shoes worn for activities she will be alright. I remember having similar sneakers when I was young, I wore them in an appropriate manner so no harm done -- I did however wear the wrong sized shoes for soccer which has resulted in 5 foot-surgeries. That came from one-size fits all theory in the late 70's/early 80's."
My 6 year old wears these daily.  She loves them.  They've held up well for 99% daily wear over three months.  Look good as new.
"I had been wanting another pair of the unbleached Converse Chuck Taylor's for years.  I am so glad that they fit the same as they did years ago.  My feet are a little wide.  So I order the unisex size and not the women's shoes, as I find the women's fit snugger.  These are made well and I'm completely satisfied."
"I've almost always gone with the traditional black with white trim, but I am really glad I made the switch to all black. My son loves mine and he wants me to get him some as well (and he's a fan of sweet basketball shoes - this is the first pair of Chucks that he's coveted). Chucks always run a bit narrow and small, so I marked it as fits as expected, but that's because as a longtime wearer I know what to expect. If you haven't worn chucks before, you may want to go half a size larger than normal, or just lace it loose."
"My eighth-grade daughter will only wear the shoes. They are very expensive considering what they are made of and how simply they are made-they were designed in the 50s. But they are quality. Terrible arch support though, If you need that."
"A little long for my size 10 feet (about 1.25"" gap between my toe and the shoe tip), or maybe I've abused my feet with small shoes for so long lol. All in all it's okay. Came looking and smelling brand new, so yay."
"I have a ton of Converse shoes, all-stars, low top, high top, DC graphics, camo graphics, canvas, smooth leather, suede, etc. that number around 15 pairs in my closet so I am very familiar with this shoe, but this blue thatch design on these Converse are probably the most boss I have seen.  You can almost wear these with a blue suit, they look that cool!  They come with the black rope laces and also a pair of flat black laces, but I like the rope ones because they are unique.  I have to confess, I have never paid this much for a pair of Converse since I troll another auction site for good bargains, but when I saw this pair and observed how somewhat rare they are (at least for now) I had to have them!  If you own Converse, you know how they all typically fit the same with no arch so no surprises here except for the updated classic look."
"Shoes are cute, but totally ridiculous. I've worn the same size for more years than I care to remember, so I could not have made a mistake and accidently ordered the wrong size. These are way too small. Very uncomfortable to wear. I got blisters just wearing them for a day."
"Teen Daughter purchased these with birthday money.  She wears a 10-10.5 women's shoe and purchased these in a Men's size 8.  She indicates these fit very well.  Also, it has been a few months and these shoes are worn frequently and they still are looking good and holding up better than expected.  Shoes are often worn all day and are comfortable."
"This converse is like any other converse, but my biggest problem is how you cannot remove the insole to replace it with something like Dr. Scholls foot insoles or inserts. Disappointed. There are other shoes made by converse (the ones that look like vans) that allow you to do this."
Wanted to like these so badly! I have long feet and converses tend to dramatize it and these are no exception. I have a 9.5 (women's) foot so ordered a 7.5 mens...should have gone 7 maybe even 6.5...go atleast a half size down ladies. Other than that they are great shoes for the price.
"The pair arrived as expected. They are somewhat large/wide. I normally wear 8.5 but ordered 8.0 as the site suggested, unfortunately, they are still large/wide but I like them all the same. I would highly recommend."
"These are my new favourite shoes. Very comfortable. If you have issues with arch support / Thin bottoms, you may dislike them, but for me its perfect. I wouldn't recommend them for running, as the padding leaves something to be desired. Color in picture is spot on with real life color. Lace adjustment gives a perfect fit.<br/><br/>Plus..... they are so darned cute! Also, good for an eccentric man who likes to show off a bit. Definitely trendy."
Nice looking pair of Converse shoes. Will definitely wear them often as they are some of my favorite looking shoes. They have always been comfortable even though I have somewhat wide feet. Converse will be a shoe that I'll keep coming back to.
"These shoes are great for all ages. They are so versatile as they can be worn with jeans, skirt etc. Can easily be worn all year round. The only draw back is if you have wide feet they may not be the most comfortable shoe."
"I bought these for my eight year old little sister and she's loving them. She says they are very confortable, very bright and vivid color and loves showing them off. Her first pair of chucks! I'm a proud sister! Very good buy, arrived pretty quickly as well. Great stiching and laces (came with two pair-black and white) If you're getting these shoes to work in, I don't recommend. They are made tobe confortable but have very little sole support and the toes are kinda squished so perfect for little feet (like mine and sister's)  I have bought three pairs from this site, very great buy!"
"I work with a friend who is the biggest Chuck Taylor fan of all time.  She has who knows how many pairs of Chucks (over 20), and always seems to wear a different color every day.  So to be a good friend, I had to get a pair.  Red, being one of my favorite colors, seemed the right choice.  I bought size 6.5 Men's, which translates to 8.5 Women's.  The fit is good!  These are heavier than I would have expected, but they aren't uncomfortably so.  They are very sturdy considering so much of them is made from canvas.  My feet feel well supported.  While I probably won't go bonkers over them, I might have to invest in a second pair."
"These are a half-size smaller than every other pair of Chucks I own. I wanted them a bit larger than my other Chucks because I'll be wearing them in the winter with thick socks. I ordered them in an 8.5 (they are marked 6.5 on the bottom). But when I hold them up to a pair of size 8s (marked 6 on the bottom) that I already own, they are the exact same size.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with these is that the insoles are glued in with some super-strong adhesive, so it was very difficult to remove them and insert some decent insoles.<br/><br/>Also, FYI that this is a VERY dark navy. They look blue in the daylight, but more like black indoors."
"These will not provide good arch support, they are very flat. However, that is to be expected from Converse. Nevertheless, I am in love with these shoes! They are comfortable, I can wear them anywhere and they are so stylish. These are just what I wanted. I am a female and I ordered the men's 6.5 for my 8.5 women's size feet. They're slightly large, but Converse tend to be tight anyway so I can't complain. LOVE THEM"
"Been looking a long time for these . Wore several pair out going up . Thought they were a thing of the past . Was glad to found some again . For what shoes go for these days , these are a great deal . Plus ankle support as a bonus . Regards gh"
"Got these for my daughter to match my own. It's quite tricky to speculate how they felt for her, since she hates shoes in general. But with the high tops, I do feel that their is more support as she is learning to walk. I just love the way they look! Speaking for myself about the lack of arch support--that's why I like them."
I bought these Chuck Taylor Lo Top sneakers for my granddaughter for her 13th birthday.  She just loves them.  They fit perfectly.  They are a smart-looking sneaker.<br/><br/>I highly recommend these sneakers.
I normally wear a women's size 10 so I ordered a men's size 8 as suggested. They were way too big. I am returning for a men's size 7.
"I love them....love the color (Royal Blue.) I've gotten many compliments, on my chucks. They are comfortable and a great alternative to flip flops. Added bonus, the delivery was as described and as scheduled."
"Classic Chucks are just that, nothing more and nothing less.  They go with just about anything, and are acceptable in most social situations these days.  My daughter wears orthotics anyway, so the lack of arch support is not an issue.  She wears them all day almost every day.  Her feet freeze in them during the winter, but it's about the look!"
"If I were reviewing these as athletic shoes I would have to give them two or three stars. However, these are for fashion. As such, they are comfortable, wear well and break in quickly. These shoes look good worn to death and are comfortable for fashion shoes."
"Accidentally ordered a half size larger than my other converse. Didn't want to pay to mail them back and exchange them for the right size so I gave them to a friend. Looked exactly the same as my other converse, so I don't suspect that they're fake. And they arrived very quick."
"I bought these because my feet are flat, shoes with built-in arch supports hurt. My feet are also size 14 wide, I bought the shoes in 15D and haven't had any issues. I added some Dr. what's his name's heal/back supports, which allows me to wear them casually most of the day.  I bought them for stalking wild game because of their light weight and sensitivity to terrain."
"My husband loved these, he collects unusual chucks, and these were right up his alley. He is a 13.5 narrow, and the 13 (we have found chucks to be a half size bigger) fits him perfectly."
"Anyone knows Converse All Star hightops are always a classic shoe. though you will need an insole, the exuberate fun and youth to all wear and see others wearing these shoes.<br/><br/>i had one problem though. The invoice  clearly states I should have received an extra pair of black laces with my shoes, which I did not receive. The extra laces depicted in the product description that SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE BOX WITH MY SHOES.<br/><br/>Amazon did refund me $6 instead of sending me the laces. For future reference, be sure you get what you pay for in the product description."
"They are flat so their is no arch support, but I use them for lifting shoes, which they are recommended specifically for the flat soles. I also like wearing them all day as my everyday shoe too. I still have another pair that are close to 3 years old, and they are still in great shape except the tread was getting worn down. They have outlasted all my other brands."
"Every pair of chuck's I have ever owned wear size 5.5 in women's. From the reviews I believed that these ran small, so I bought a size 6 in women's. I normally wear size 6 or 6.5 in every other brand of shoe. The size 6 was way too big. Then I got the 5.5, and they are still too big. I was surprised given that the 5.5 had always been perfect in this brand previously."
"When you go to buy your shoes, go for a size or two lower than your shoe size. I wear 15 US Mens, and i ordered a size 14 US Mens, and that ended up bigger than my foot by one size, so i suggest getting 2 sizes smaller just in case, or you can measure your feet, and check with Converse's sizing charts. But yet, overall great quality for the price, you should get it in a week or so, i live in Louisiana, and they ship from California, so it's actually pretty ok shipping also.. Sorry for the huge comment, but it's useful to know what your buying. Oh, and btw, in the description it says that they throw in extra laces, but i didn't receive any, soo.. Don't get excited for extra laces"
"These are my favorites. I wear them with my scrubs every day! Comfortable and so cute! I'm always getting compliments from men and women alike! They don't have an insane amount of arch support to start but I find that as I break them in, they kind of mold to my feel becoming more supportive. Love em!"
"I love the way these look.  They are a perfect fit for my daughter.  She has a very narrow foot.  For me, they are a bit too narrow at the toes.  I got a blister the first 2x I wore them.  They don't have a ton of arch support but I was OK after walking in them, in 90+ degree heat for four hours."
"Daughter loves them, very stylish. Somewhat hard to keep clean of course since they are so white."
"I got these for my 13 yr. old.  She is a huge Dr. who fan.  She got them right before we went to Italy.  I found her sleeping in them our first night there.  She never wanted to take them off.  She takes such good care of them, even cleaning them when they get a bit dirty.  She loves her converse.  She does  need to wear other insoles in them as her orthopedic Dr. says they do not give much support but since they are the high top they are better than regular converse."
"Can't beat chucks. Gotta get a gel insert as they have zero padding, but they look good and are so lightweight compared to the modern monstrosities of tennis shoes that weigh what hiking boots used to."
"Do you really need a review of All Stars? If you haven't tried them in the last 60 years, this review will not change your mind. I love these shoes, and buy a new pair in black every couple of years. My specialty colors last forever but I wear the black all the time. I wish there was more arch support, but if I really cared I could just add some. I love that they pack small in my suitcase, but are still comfy to wear all day."
"I just love these shoes, I've always wanted leather all stars."
"I was hesitant about the color, i was originally loking to buying a red or burgandy color,  ended getting the chilli paste color.....i love it! My husband saw me wearing them he asked me to get him a pair the same color. I wear a size 6 in womens and got a size 4 in mens.... fit perfectly."
"LOVE THESE! I have worn them for 4 days straight since getting them. These are so cute with ANYTHING.<br/>They are about a 1/2 size too big, so I would recommend getting a 1/2 size smaller than you normally get."
"Love my navy converse. I typically wear a 10 in womens. I have always heard they run a little big so with much back and forth, I went with a 9.5. So glad I did because they still are a tad bit big and could probably have gone with a 9, but still not too bad. Still love my converse!"
"My first order, they sent me the wrong size - a men's 9 instead of a women's 9. It wasn't my mistake; the shoes didn't match the packing slip. The second order was right, and they're my favourite shoes. Typical Converse: they're durable, comfortable, and easy to clean. They also lack arches, like all Converse shoes. I wear them to class and work, usually 12 hours or more in a day without problem. They're not tight on my feett, but my feet don't slide around. These shoes have much longer laces than high-tops I've bought elsewhere, though. Not that it's a problem; I just have to do that hipster thing where you loop the laces around your ankle before tying the bow. If I don't, I step on them."
Fit perfectly shipping was fast love the classic look
Bought these for my daughter. She loves converse and she loves them in all colors. These Navy blue converse did not disappoint. They were exactly as expected and true to size.  (She wears an adult size 6). Look great on her!
My son loves them although I did find out today that they are at least a size too big. He knew that and told me 8 on purpose so I guess he wanted them that way. I really don't understand 14 year old boys but I love him and he loves the shoes so what more could I ask for?
"I recently started a huge obsession with Converse sneakers. I'm way late to the game, but they're so great. I was searching for this color, my current favorite color, and it doesn't disappoint in person! It's beautiful. Love these shoes!"
"I was worried about the fit of these shoes, so I went to Kohl's to try them out before purchasing. I found that the shoes were true to size and purchased the corresponding size in men's for 7.5 in women's. I was really glad I tried them on in a store first because the size 7 was too small and the size 8 was too big, and most stores don't sell half sizes. The 7.5 is perfect, and the size I normally wear in shoes.<br/>They were delivered in a timely manner and the quality of the shoes are great, too! They look good and I love that I can wear them with ANYTHING! Seriously. Love these shoes."
"Great cute shoes! I would order a size smaller next time in getting these male and female type. i have gotten the womens in the past and sizing was spot on. These come in mens size/womens size. I like the extra width in these, but because of that, they were slightly large on me. Go one size smaller when you order. Love love love them and I get alot of compliments."
"They are great and gives a fun look to my wardrobe.  I guess my only complaint would be they are a tiny bit narrow until they stretch out a bit and they are kind of heavy, but other than that I enjoy wearing them."
I am not a Chucks fan! My wife bought the grey shoes for herself and I got a bit jealous. I was not loving the shoes I bought for myself and decided to get these. I love my new shoes! I normally wear a 14 and read the reviews and ordered down a size. They fit perfectly. I love the flat shoe feel on my feet. I wish I had more money so I could buy all the colors!
My daughter loves these shoes! They fit as expected and she finds them to be comfortable. They have been worn daily for about 6 months and are holding up well. She loves them so much that she even wore them with a dress to a semi-formal dance at school! I would say they were worth the cost. :)
"Very comfortable shoe. Ordered a size 8 which is my usual size, but should have ordered a 7 or 7.5.  You might want to try them on in a store first before you buy, so next time you can buy them online knowing how they fit your feet."
"Anyone that has ever owned Chucks knows they run a half to a full size big. They have and are designed with no arch support. You are buying a classic with little bells and whistles, like buying a classic car.  You have been warned so don't complain. Would I buy them again? The question is: would I ever stop?"
"I ordered down one size because we already have some of these and know they run big. The price was fanastic and the shipping was very quick. Oh, and they had navy blue which is what my daughter wanted."
"I like my Converse, what can i say? Grew up with them, wore out more than one pair. This is my 2nd pair of b/w high tops. Of course, they were probably made better back in the day, but these seem to be fine.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like is that the shoestrings don't appear to be cotton anymore. I'll have to take some from another pair because I don't like the ones that came with the new shoes."
"I love these Converse and keep replacing old ones with new ones.  Totally comfortable.  I have to put my orthotics in shoes, and these insoles do not come out; however, they are deep enough that orthotics fit on top.  That is only reason I say that they do not have good arch support."
"My sneakers arrived quicker than expected and well packaged. I usually wear a women's size 7, sometimes 7.5. I purchased the Men's 5/Women's 7. They fit slightly large, but I think the 4.5/6.5 would be a tad too small, so I am keeping the 5/7. If you are between sizes, definitely go down to the smaller one."
"They run a bit large, but it doesn't bother me much. They are comfortable and my favorite show brand because I like to be outside a lot and these don't hurt my feet when I'm doing stuff like going to the creek with friends or hiking and random stuff like that. They are pretty much good for any non-formal activity. They were shipped to my super fast and in great condition."
"These do run a bit large. Order 1/2 size smaller than what you are. I am 10-1/2 but ordered 10 and the fit is right.<br/>I like that these shoes are light and the lack of arch support has not bothered me at all. I am not using gel insoles with them. Beware these shoes are not weatherproof. Whatever the climate condition, it gets through the shoes.<br/><br/>Although I can't attest for durability yet, I am satisfied with my purchase and certainly recommend them. I really like the all-black, slim look."
Bought as a gift for my wife. I asked her what she liked about them. She said the color and style was the biggest reason for these. She said they fit her perfectly and she wears a size 6 in US women's sizes.
When it says Unisex I think I misinterpreted that. I thought that just meant the sizing but these look like they fit alien feet. Each shoe barely looks different right to left. I ordered a wider size and they are still narrower than most narrow sizes. I sent these back and ordered a pair of normal Converse Chuck Taylors. I have a hard time believing these are made by Converse. They looked very generic.
"This is my favorite color for Chucks, but getting harder to find and procure. I had to order these a size larger (the smallest available men's size) rather than in my normal women's size because they were out of stock otherwise. Wish this color would stay in circulation, but looks like I might have to hunt for a new favorite for my beloved Chucks."
"A definite staple of any 'tween / teen wardrobe these days.  Great to see these shoes stand the test of time.  Seems to be my daughter's go-to shoe, can be worn with almost anything and offers good support.  Timeless and fun."
"My daughter was begging for a pair of Chuck Taylors.  I found Amazon to be the best price and easiest way to get them. Shipped fast, fit perfect and have no flaws in the rubber molding.<br/>She is so happy about them, as they are a style standard for the high school kids again this year.  The funny thing is, I wore the same shoes 35 years ago!! I smile when I see her wearing them."
The coolest looking moderately comfortable shoe there is. Just don't run or try and walk 10 miles a day in them.
"I really could wait to get these and once they came in that were way to big. Description states unisex, tag in sneaker states men's. So unless you are a girl and buy men's size shoes already, these will not fit"
"These came in perfect condition and I couldn't be happier! I typically wear a 7 in women's shoes, which is equivalent to a men's 5, but converse always tend to run a half size bigger on me and other people I know, so I ordered a 4.5 and they fit me wonderfully. They are extremely cute and I love that they are still just like the old ones."
"I really enjoyed these shoes, and as a big fan of converse, these lived up to exactly what I expected. They were high quality, and fit exactly as I expected them to. The reason i selected no arch support is because the bottom of these shoes are completely flat. I wear these all day, and they stay comfortable throughout the day unless doing activities like running, which would be better suited for a more athletic shoe. There are many easy and different ways to tie these shoes, and you can switch the laces out to easily customize to match an outfit. If you are looking for a shoe that matches pretty much any outfit, go with the black version of these high tops, these go well with pants of any kind."
"I love Converse Chuck Taylor High tops.  A warning, these run big!  I was surprised to find that when I ordered the size I normally wear in old Converse, I found them to be too big and had to exchange.  Whenever I have a pair of these high tops, I put some sort of padded insert inside them.  It makes them SO much more comfortable and wearable all day long."
They look great and are super comfortable. Only problem I have is that they are a little larger than expected since I am usually a 7 w in converse shoes but they look great with boyfriend jeans so it really doesn't matter since they don't slip from my feet.  Next time I will prefer 1/2 size smaller.
"I've been wearing Converse Hi-Tops as around the house and casual walking shoes for over a decade. They're inexpensive, last fairly well, and tend to be well-constructed. There is some arch support, but these are not high-tech shoes. I love them anyway, and greatly enjoy the fact that they are identical to the Converse Hi-Tops I wore when I was in grammar school."
"Shoes were returned as they were too big. I own other All Stars size 11 that fit well, but these didn't. To be fair, this particular brand is really size-erratic, I also own a couple other All Stars size 10.5 that fit perfectly fine. Hard to guessl before you actually try them on."
"I've never owned a pair of Converse before; I was surprised at how comfortable these are. Since they haven't been broken in-- they're brand new-- I don't think I could wear them all day, but then again, I haven't tried yet. I got size 8 B(M) US women/ 6 B(M) US men, and they fit perfectly. I was nervous about the size since I don't really know my shoe size, but the results were above satisfying. They came in a very short amount of time-- a couple days. I'm really happy I bought these."
A classic that continues to withstand the test of time.  I purchased these for my teenage daughter - these are becoming a hot fashion  item with her age group.  Our only complaint is that they run large.  She is a solid 9 but these seem to fit almost a full size too large. Friends who have the same shoes all said the same - too large.
"I had never grown up wearing converse so I was skeptical that I wouldn't be pleased with the quality. I bought them blind (having never tried them on) as a last minute purchase before a trip through Europe, having been dissapointed with a number of shoes that I tried on in stores. I'm fairly picky with my shoes, being a little flat footed, and I knew that I would be walking a lot on my trip. I read reviews about the sizing and they all say the same thing, I ordered half a size down from what I usually wear (I normally flirt between 10.5-11) so I went with size 10s and they fit like a charm. These don't provide a ton of padding but if you're like me and prefer a more minimalist shoe then these are the way to go. Oh, and I love the Burgundy color, they are a nice rich red and have only faded a touch where I've manage to scuff them."
Great looking shoes at a reasonable price. I love wearing flat soled shoes for working out and just wearing around the house. They feel more comfortable than the typical shoe that tries to mold your foot into some non biological shape. These are I guess considered fashionable but I find them pretty functional.
I got the shark skin grey and they're so cool! Don't forget that with chucks they're unisex so you may need to go down a 1/2 size. Like I have a wide foot with a high instep and typically wear 8.5 but I should have gotten an 8.
"Great value for the price.  Love the leather and appearance.  The shoes comes a bit long in length and a bit narrow in width compared to other size 10's. I normally wear  I'd recommend adding some arch support/padding inserts if you plan to wear these shoes all day or are doing a bit of walking.  Since the shoe runs a bit big, you should have enough room to add a comfy insert.  Also, they don't breathe super well and your feet get hot after long hours of use/walking.  They are more fashion than function."
The only thing that I would have to say is that these are more of a grey/green/brown. It is not really a true grey color. Other than that they fit perfectly and are a great pair of classic Chuck Taylor's.
"I choose this rating because I thought I was getting the black monoch ""leather ones"", but when my shoes arrived I was disappointed. I believe this is a error on my behalf. Mainly because I didn't see nor did I care to confirm it, but should I have? Either way I love these shoes and I love these wrong ones and I am not that upset just disappointed. This clearly is a mistake that will not happen twice! And for the record these shoes are eligible for Free Returns, So I am happy with my poor choice.<br/><br/>Overall the shoes seem to checkout. I looked over them and they seem to check out. the badge is there and the name on the heel is spelt correct, so I LIKE!<br/><br/>Believe it or not but this is and will not be my last shoe purchase from Amazon. However, it is my first and I'd recommend buying from amazon to family, friends and shoppers."
"If you've never had classic Chuck's as an adult, go try them on before ordering online.  They run a little big.  I wear 13 for the most part and had to get 12's."
"Converses run large, and my boyfriend informed me of that. So I instantly got him a size smaller. He usually wears a size 10 and a size 9 fit him perfectly. He refuses to tie the shoe, but the fit and comfort level and the quality of the shoe he says meets the standard you would find from a converse that you'd get from the store. This converse is the older model, they have a newer model on the market now that they sell at Journeys and stores like that. I don't know how to explain the difference but they do look pretty different. my boyfriend loves the older model so he was excited to get these."
"Just what I wanted.  I normally wear a 7 1/2, but they didn't have them in my size.  I ordered an 8.  As excepted, they are just a touch large, but nothing I can't handle.  I just don't want to wear them outside because I want to keep them nice and white.  :)"
"I think my feet have shrunk size in graduated high school in 1989 or I was wearing a half size bigger back then to make my small feet look bigger- you know, to impress the ladies! Anyway the shoes haven't changed at all, zero arch support, thin soles and classic style. These are the original ""barefoot"" shoes! Those toe-shoe monstrosities can suck it."
These shoes are awesome...we just keep buying them. Sure wish they'd get the size labeling right though. It's very strange to buy a size 9 when you wear a 10 1/2. Other than that they're great.
"This is the third pair I have bought my daughter in white. Out of all the colors of Chuck T's she has, the white pair is what gets worn the most. She loves them!! Item was delivered on time and just as described online."
Old School Gold!  No flashy like most of today's other shoes but I grew up with these and it is great to go back to the old reliable.  Comfortable and still stylish...at least to me.  Also you have to take out a mortgage on the house for some of the new shoes out there.  $50 for a pair of Chuck's...you bet send me a pair.  I may get a black pair as well.
"A bit large, about 1/2 a size. Also, being ""charcoal"" i expected a darkish grey, these are more of a tactical ""dry earth"" brown. That's fine, just not what i expected"
"These are the only shoes my daughter will wear for running around, other than Addidas slides for the beach, she is 49 and has been wearing these for 10? years,,"
I have wanted my red converse for years. But I am an amputee and have to wear a brace on the other leg for better support. The shoes don't fit with the brace I am crushed. This is no fault of the shoes or the company who sent them. I need to return them but my heart breaks at the thought.
I love the color of these shoes. They were bright and fun. I ordered the size my daughter wears normally but these were like clown shoes on her unfortunately. I suggest going down a size.
"I wear a 6.5 or 7 in most shoes, and a 7 fit perfectly. Maybe slightly bigger than expected but hard to say. They run about a half size bigger, or so I read. That's probably pretty accurate. Easy fit though. Highly recommend. Packaged well and no defects."
"It's hard to find ""1/2 sizes"" in the store. These fit perfectly and are just as good quality as buying from the store. Will purchase again when this pair is wore out."
"I bought these for my 21 year old son. He only likes Converse, and this is my go to place for them. The only reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is that their is no arch support. If your feet can handle it, they're great shoes. They last him about a year, but he's very hard on his shoes."
"Super cute, comfy shoe but I do feel like these are about a half size too big, at least for my feet. Still a great buy. When these are old and used, I'll buy another pair, but size 7 instead of 7.5. Recommended!"
"I purchased these for my husband and loves them. He wanted a playful shoe for our play vacations to disney world, and other casual events. Personally, I am not crazy about them on a grown man, but he is very youthful and they work well for him with his casual jeans or cargo shorts. He loves them and is quite happy."
I really liked them at first a bit tight around the toes. Issue is the side started to rip off the sole
"Nice shoe but Converse seems to have its own take on the color ""charcoal.""  They appear brownish green.  I had hoped to use gray laces, but I cannot match the color of the shoes."
"You have to either sweat in them or dunk them in water, then walk around outside in them. This gets them to mold to your feet.These are going to be house shoes (a.k.a. slippers) I have a black pair (size 13) which I use for the street. Hand washing with mild soap (Ivory) is best, but you can machine wash on the gentle cycle."
"I ordered these shoes to use for my powerlifting training sessions only. They look and fit great and helped me to do better in my deadlifts and squats as I had been using running shoes previously. As far as ever using them for work or walking or jogging I would not use them for those purposes as they dont provide enough cushion or arch support. I am a heavy person and need orthopedic shoes for those activities but when it comes to doing deadlifts and squats these shoes are great, I just pulled 10 more pounds yesterday on my deadlift in part thanks to these shoes therefore I rate them at 5 stars. Shipping and delivery was quick, price was good. I would buy another pair."
Been wearing Converse for 37 years and have never had a pair I didn't love! This color is perfect for so many things because it's a very light olive green. Thanks for staying consistent Converse and not changing a perfect shoe!!!
"These chucks are great!  Color and style were just as I expected, and despite running a bit large, I was very pleased with the sizing because I can use a comfortable shoe insert in each shoe without any issue.  Definitely recommend!"
"These shoes are really great! Just got them today, and I am so excited to wear them!! They came 2 days early too!! Before I purchased these, I read other peoples' reviews. A lot of them mentioned getting them a 1/2 size down. I am usually a 9 in womens, so I got a mens 6.5 which = a womens 8.5. They fit great!! So I would definitely recommend getting your shoes a 1/2 size down! They look really nice, and clean!! So excited to start wearing them!!"
"On advice from a colleague to use chucks for lifting I decided to give this is a shot.  Best decision ever, the ankle support and the flat bottom heels provide excellent base for lifting and I can never go without now."
These are classics.  Gotta love them.  But they really aren't the most comfortable shoes.  I put arch supports in them so I am able to wear them all day.  Otherwise they hurt my feet.  But of course they look great and go with everything!
"These are adorable, and I love the way they look, but they are not very sturdy. I have had mine a couple months and wear them maybe once a week, and some of my grommets fell out."
"These were bought as a sweet 16 present for my niece. She loves Converse and Burgundy is her favorite color. These were a big hit! The shoes are well made, as to be expected, and fit perfectly."
"They look great but I can't wear them all day since I walk a lot. They are great for the weekend when I walk less. So cute with jeans and fit well and a good price. However, if they weren't a good price I would feel cheated because you can't walk far in them."
Got them in only a few days. They're exactly what I ordered. They are a little bit snug in the toe but its OK. My old pair stretched out after a little bit of breaking them in. The color is so freaking pretty. I wanted to wear them today but its snowy and rainy today where I live. I didn't want to ruin them already!! I just purchased another pair in a different color too! Definitely worth the order!
Toe area is very narrow for a person with a wide foot. I owned the originals back in 1964 while playing HS basketball. These are only worn a couple hours at a time for now. I added  Doctor Scholls gel inserts inside for comfort. I am wearing them everyday now for a few hours to break them in.
"These were a birthday gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves them. She did try a pair on in the store that were a different color though to make sure the fit was right. She ended up having to go with a men/boys pair but they are the exact same outside of the male/female interior label so no worries with buying a pair and it looks girly or too boyish. Just make sure to try them on somewhere before ordering online cause they will fit different than most other shoes. Make sure if they do, usually a girl, but make sure you order the right sized 5 boy vs 5 girl."
"The crazy thing about my ""Chuck Taylor"" Converse sneakers....they look so ""unconstructed"" compared to my ""highly constructed"" sneakers...but they are SOOOO completely comfortable...may the saying actually applies..Less is More!!!"
"These shoes are so much fun!  They are a bit long, but better a little long than a little short!  I used to buy these Converse Chuck Taylor high-tops for my boys when they were young skateboarders.  They were thrilled that their old mom is now wearing bright red ones for walking to the beach.  I wore them to the gym the other day and got several remarks.........people surprised to see a 77 year old woman wearing such fun shoes.  Never too old!!"
"I remember buying these exact same Chucks for 39.99 not too long ago what happened since then? Other than that, still a great shoe, comfortable and classic. Wear them with anything anywhere. I did buy my normal size and half a size down but I ended up keeping my normal size. The smaller size did fit but I was more comfy in my normal size, I don't feel that they run abnormally large. I am now ready to order in pink and green next. I love the high tops, I never liked how the low tops looked on me, the high tops offer more option and style in my opinion."
My other pairs have always had a harder rubber applied  over parts (most) of the sole. These do not. I wonder if they missed a step or stopped doing it. It certainly makes (made) them last longer.
"I love chucks. However I should have gone down a size or half a size when I purchased these. I usually wear an 8, sometimes a 7.5 but i know chucks usually run big so I always order 7.5 so they fit perfectly. These ones were waaaaaay too big even tho I ordered a 7.5. Because I live in Bermuda and it's too much trouble to return them and wait for a new pair I decided to simply keep em and wear them for winter with some big socks. They are a good looking shoe. But the sizing is waaay off"
"We now have a converse outlet store at our outlet mall so they are way cheaper there, but I purchased my first pair here. I'm now on my second pair and will probably always have several colors of converse. They are comfy and super cute!"
"I've always loved Converse Low Cuts, especially for riding bike and walking around town. These fit great, are narrow enough to ride my road bike with, comfortable enough to walk in, and look good. I didn't notice any of the defects some other reviewers mentioned, so I guess I got a great pair!"
"I ordered a 7 and got a size 5 in the brands sizing, so they just about fit but probably only for a few more months because my feet will outgrow them in no time."
"READ: THEY RUN VERY LARGE<br/><br/>Classic shoes, exactly as expected. Only gripe is I usually wear a size 10, in these I ordered a 9.5, they were WAY too big, so I reordered an 8.5 and they are still a little large. I'm going to keep them, but in all honesty, I should probably have an 8.  So remember that when ordering."
As pictured and as expected. I saw no defects.<br/><br/>I ordered the women's size 7 and they seem close but maybe 1/4 size large. I tend to slide and squeak a bit in them.
I already love converses and these are so cute and versatile for a man or a woman. Thesee came exactly as I wanted them too. They fit just right so if you usually vary on size make sure you check measurments. I'm super excited about how this are going to match all of my cute summer outfits!
"My rating is for the pink pair. I love Converse, but was very disappointed to find what appeared to be a nice bubblegum pink on screen, was in fact a more neon, slightly-salmon colored pink. Had to return them. :("
"My fiance loves Chuck Taylors, so when I found this on in Pink I had to get them. They are actual chuck taylors and not the knock offs.  The stiching and colors don't bleed."
"White shoes tend to get dirty fast, but my last pair lasted a good 2 years, so I plan to keep buying these classic stylish shoes. And at the 50-dollar range, these are the best style for the money."
"New item in original box. Fits just like they used too. Been a while since I purchased one. No arch support for this one, but new ones on their website Chuck Taylor II has some type of inner sole arch support. How well they work, no idea."
"Everyone pretty much knows what to expect with Converse - they're great, reliable shoes and look good with almost any outfit choice. You have to wear them in a little but after that they're your favorite, go-to shoe. Good price, fast shipping with this order."
"They are Lo Top Chuck Taylor's what more can I say? Converse, in general, run a tad big, so I'd order on the low side of your shoe size. These are awesome everyday shoes. They are made with canvas, so they don't get very hot. I wouldn't recommend wearing on a rainy day, but these shoes last a super long time, and only get better as they get roughed up."
"The high-tops with the star--and stripes! It just doesn't get any better than that! Like all canvas 'sneakers', there isn't much in the way of 'foot support' (think of walking around all day in your bedroom slippers!) but if you throw in a decent set of in-soles, you feet will be just fine....and your LEGS will thank you for not forcing them to drag around heavy leather/plastic'sports' shoes! Another benefit is 1/2 sizes....you shouldn't have to choose between a 10 (too small?) or an 11 (too big?) if you normally wear a 10.5!"
"These shoes are extremely popular with teenagers. I've been keeping my eye out for a good deal, and it finally showed up on Amazon. They arrived on time and fit exactly as expected. Great shoes, great price and great service."
"they are comfortable shoes I wear them around campus, I walk to all of my classes and I work in retail ( standing all day) they did not hurt my feet, one day we all went adventuring ( they are not made to walk for 4+ hours at a time) but they are comfortable"

"I received these shoes in an envelope, without the original box.  There was not an extra pair of black laces included as was advertised on the seller's page.  This made me wonder if they are somehow counterfit.  They seem the same as my other white converse, but I don't understand why they were sent the way they were.<br/><br/>So, the stars are for the shoes, not the seller.  The shoes fit like all converse, not really very comfortable, but cute as hell."
These are the cutest high tops ever!!!  We all loved them-even my grandbaby.  She prissed around all over the place because she thought she looked so good-and she did!!
"I read a lot of reviews with some apprehension about sizing. There was much contention about sizing too small vs. chart, unisex vs. gender specific and so on, almost information over load. I wear a men's size 13D normally. I ordered the Unisex size 13 men's / 15 women's and they fit as advertised, perfect. The quality is excellent.  All I can figure is different vendor's may list there size's differently? Though my experience was great; clearly many other buyers were not satisfied. All I can state is the vendor I dealt with was great!"
"One of the shoes I received had mud/dirt caked all over it so I'm returning them. Other than that, it seems like they'd be comfortable though they seem a big large, even taking into account the men's to women's size conversion. I have owned many pairs of Chucks and always wear a 7.5 (I'm a 8.5 in literally every other shoe) but this pair felt a bit larger than my other pairs. Maybe I need to go 1.5 sizes down. I don't want to buy from this seller and I think I need to try these on first, so I'm go to an actual shoe store to replace the pair I'm returning."
I misread the size and ordered a woman's size.  My fault but I gave them to my son rather than returning them.  He loves them!  I'd buy them again but be more diligent about size and if it is in male/female.
Size was at least 1 - 1.5 sizes too large.  Color is PINK not purple or violet.  Shipper required me to pay return shipping and it has been 10 days to date with no refund.
"My daughter says you need to have bright colors and stand out. She wanted these shoes, in this color, so this is what she got. She loves them and they fit as expected."
"Supposedly I ordered a ""D"" width. After receiving them, it appears that this is a standard width shoe, and I need something a little wider. I intend to use them only for mowing a lot of yard, so that's not going to be a real problem, but I wouldn't want wear them all day."
The shoes fit great they're great style what more do I need to say they're Converse but this review is asking for more than 18 plus words so I will just ramble on about how many words I have to type in in order to submit a review for a pair of Converse
Transferring women to mens sizes was a bit tough.  And they are just a bit large.  But I am over all happy with them.  Shipped and arrived WAY quicker than expected too.
"maybe mine was just a random manufacture defect, the rivets on the laces on 1 shoe popped off within a week, no big deal, shoes still work and tie up, but b/c of that i can't use it for crazy activities, i mainly use it for gym lifting sessions now. b/c of that it gets 3/5"
I ordered my usual 8.5 in women's yet this shoes was too long. (Although Good width because I have wide feet) My big toe reaches to where the white part begins so I can still wear the shoes. Just wish they were true to size
Good shoes but converse size 9's are almost an inch bigger than normal size 9's. I have returned my pair and bought a size smaller because their sizing is very large.
Love these! Fits as expected. I've not been disappointed at all with the quality. They are far from orthopedic but I wear them all day without any problems. If you typically don't have feet problems I imagine you can do the same.
"Unisex size chart not accurate. Sneakers were too small and looks cheap, the leather looks like hard pleather. Returned item and the refund had $13.90 deducted from my purchase price. ???"
"Not for running, not for walking, just a shoe. They are comfortable with a reliable fit in sizing. They run large (as women's size). Normally, I need a 7.5 in any other athletic-type shoe. With these I wear a men's 5/women's 7 and still have a bit of room in the toe, which is perfect. The construction is sturdy for a lightweight shoe and holds up under at least moderate wear. Definitely going to continue to buy these shoes as long as they keep making them!!!"
"I got these for my daughter because I favor black Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star high-tops myself when I wear sneakers, and she likes to clomp around in them, so I thought I'd get her her own pair. Once she found out they come in pink, no other color would do.  Sigh.  But they are SUPER cute, and the lacing up the ankles means they fit tight and won't come off, but lots of room to grow through the toes.  One drawback, the laces are hard for a toddler to manage, and she has extreme difficulty getting them off by herself."
"I used to have a lot of foot pain before I started wearing Chuck Taylors, these shoes just fit just right. I'm on my second pair now and they just fit,, didn't even need to break them in. This is also a great shoe made without animal products, most plant based shoes tend to be a bit too narrow,"
"I've never been one to wear Converses, but I decided to try these out for the first time... and they're now my go-to's. The ordering process was seamless and quick, and the shoes themselves offer sufficient support for those who have feet a little wider at the toes."
"These normally run for $54 so I was more than happy to get them at such a low price. They are legit! I needed pink shoes for a Gwenpool cosplay and I figured I'd pay an extra few dollars for good shoes. Best idea I had, converse last forever!"
"The shoes are beautiful but unfortunately the size was to big for me and due the distance I'm living it's impossible to ask for a return. I would recommend to identify in the ""size list""  that if is for men o women."
I wear a women's 9 in a shoe and brought a size women's 8 in these. They fit perfect. Converse for both women and men seem to run 1 whole size bigger than your regular size. So consider buying the size down from your normal size in this shoe . Trust me. It will fit perfect.
"They were not the same as pictured. I believe that these sneakers were ""knock offs"", not real Converse sneakers. My grandson was disappointed and I returned them."
Very misleading on size. Says unisex so I purchased a 5.5 thinking it was a womens and apparently they are actually a 7.5 in womens! Also I have to pay out of my return to ship these back. Absolutely ridiculous.
"The comfort level is typical for converse. They don't provide arch support. They are more narrow than is comfortable for me, which is why I can only wear them comfortably for 1 hour."
"excellent product very happy I guarantee, and exellent service from seller"
"These fit like what I am used to seeing in a Chuck Allstar. For these I normally wear a mens 9 (Womens 11) . In all other converse, like the JV Allstars, I wear a Mens 9.5 - 10. They are a really great looking shoe and I am hoping they last a few years!"
NOPE.. you will have really achy feet within hours.. These are very thin and offer no support at all.. !!!
Not my favorite- first pair of Chucks EVER! I am happy to say that I have continued to wear them from time to time but the color is terrible.. The white becomes so dirty so quickly! I should have thought about that and stuck to black so here is my advice.
"They are Converse Chuck Taylors.... what didja expect? They aren't like most sneakers, but kinda like a slipper. Comfortable to wear but have no arch support....... old school shoe."
Best shoes ever. Only bought these because I finally wore out of my other lowtop chucks after 10 years of continuous use. Lots of toe room for those who like to be able to move their toes while wearing shoes; they don't feel cloistered in there at all. Excellent breathability.
"Typical Chucks.  I wouldn't wear them to work out or to go to an amusement park all day, but to hang out they are fine.  :-)"
"I have been wearing all-stars for 30+ years now and with the new owner of the brand / manufacturer - these shoes are worth the extra money. The build quality is like three times better than it used to be... and hey, they look really cool."
"Great shoes.  I use them to workout, particularly for squats, deadlifts, barbell rows, etc.  The sole provides traction and stability when lifting weights.  You could never go jogging in these kinds of shoes, but for stability they are good.<br/><br/>And yes, the other reviewers are right:  The sizing on these shoes means you need to order a size smaller than usual.  At first, I thought the shoes were too narrow, but they are much better after you break them in."
