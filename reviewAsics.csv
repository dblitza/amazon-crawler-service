review
"I have plantar fasciitis and I originally bought the gel venture 4's which were great. So I figured I'd get the 5's. As soon as I put the 5's on I remembered why I bought this shoe in the 4 model. It's very cushiony throughout, has a nice cushy deep heel cup, and has nice arch supports. All things I need in a shoe. I am going to say that I can walk all day in these shoes as I could and still can in the 4's which are 2 years old at this point. All in all for 40 bucks you can not beat this shoe. I can't believe I waited 2 years to buy new shoes especially with plantar fasciitis."
"The toe portion of the shoe is already coming off. Not just on one, but both. I expected better from Asics."
"I do need to qualify this review, as I had no intention of using this as a running shoe.  It was purchased for its looks and availability in 4E width.  The price is less than half of what normally put out for pounding the pavement.<br/><br/>First, it is a nice walking or casual shoe.  For under $40, it is well constructed, and I really like the understated look of the shoes.  After some use, it is very comfortable for standing or walking.  I even has pulling loops behind the heel, which I though had disappeared from these shoes in the name of economy.<br/><br/>Running in these shoes isn't recommended, in my opinion.  Most running shoes in wide or extra wide widths typically have a lot of support, because there is usually a parallel assumption that the user is relatively heavy.  This show provides only a medium level support and cushioning.  Two other items will not make running in these shoes a bargain.  The area over the big toe is not reinforced and will wear out prematurely for runners.  I know this from experience with two pairs of ASICS GT-2170, which were great running shoes otherwise.  ASICS knows this is an issue; more recent shoes such as their GT-1000 are reinforced in that area.  Finally, my ankles have no clearance to the top edge of this shoe and contacts it when running (but not walking).  This is an issue, and maybe why the shoes are sold at a steep discount.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a well made casual shoes (5 stars), but unless you're running distance races in Chuck Taylor All Stars, this isn't a great option (3 stars) for running."
"First: These are absolutely trail shoes above all else. If you do a lot of street running, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Second: Fantastic shoe. I could not believe the quality for the money I paid for them. Top notch.<br/><br/>I run a 10k on the road every day, and after reading numerous reviews on this site and others surrounding these shoes and numerous people who use them for road running, I decided to bite. I am on a budget, and this is a hard time of year to find street shoes for less than a hundred bucks. After coming from a light weight street running shoe, I absolutely cannot recommend these for street running. I know they are a trail running or ""multi surface running shoe"", but after seeing the sheer volume of users who take to the black top with them I decided to bite.<br/><br/>So, why don't I like them for street running, you may ask? Primarily, weight. These are bulky, at least twice the weight of my previous shoe, and the break in period was quite painful for the first week.<br/><br/>I took my dogs to some very steep local trails recently (I live near the very hilly finger lakes region of New York) and these shoes are PHENOMENAL trail shoes. I was running top speed through a very narrow, tree, rock, and root ridden trail that curved this way and that with almost every step and felt unstoppable. The grip felt like I had cleats on. Despite the speed, I could turn on a dime, using trees to propel my momentum through the curves, and not feeling a thing beneath my feet despite the various terrain types I was covering (from rocky to slipper needle covered loose dirt).<br/><br/>I knocked a star for personal reasons, and really, it's a reason that the shoe wasn't exactly designed for, so I'm not really sure if it's even fair for me to do so. I only did this as many other reported a great road running experience, and I feel they came up short in that regard.<br/><br/>As far as trail running goes: are their better shoes out there? Yes. Are you going to find them for anywhere near this price? Absolutely not. If you're on a budget, and run trails, these are your shoe.<br/><br/>And lastly, as I forgot to mention above, the fit was perfect."
"I buy a lot of ASICS shoes because 1) I know what size I wear, 2) the price is right, 3) selection is good, and 4) they're comfortable. But I only use them for casual wear....I don't run in them. I bought this particular model because of the muted, earth-tone colors that looked much better with casual slacks than the neon style of most running shoes. While the previous models I've purchased have been comfortable, they were very lightly constructed, lacking much stability or cushioning. And they weren't durable, with my toe rubbing through the top surface within a couple of months.<br/><br/>These are different. I've had them about five months now and my toe hasn't yet frayed the upper mesh. Plus, the stability and cushioning seem more substantial and my feet don't hurt during the day. Love the shoes."
"I needed outdoor running shoes for Summer volleyball.  I am glad I found these Asics shoes in my size.  And the best thing was they were on sale here at Amazon. The shoes offer great support and traction which reduces slipping while playing on grass. The shoes are also comfortable.  I added new insoles to increase the comfort which will help with trail walking, running or hiking. I have tried and purchased many pairs of running shoes (Nike, Addidas, Saucony, New Balance, Fila) over the past 10 years and recently started to looking at Asics.  I am glad I was able find and purchase 6 pairs of Asics running shoes and running socks this year alone.  Once you find the right pair of shoes and socks that fit you can't help but order more.  Great product, service and quality!"
"Had the shoe for about a month soo... Shoe is decent, I would think it would give more support for long days at work on your feet. I know its on concrete floor but still I expect a outdoor walking/running shoe to help with comfort.  I wear a 11.5 D and got it in the same size I wear, and took a chance to not get the side since 4E would be too big. The standard shoe has enough room to adjust.  Just one small issue, recently I noticed my right foot on the heel it started to rub and cause pain where every time I took a step it would hurt. Now its like a blister and I don't know what caused it, but every other shoe I own hasn't done this. Just something to look out for."
"So far the only shoes I've found that are comfortable on my large and wide feet (with narrow ankles).<br/><br/>I wear them for working out, walking, and everyday usage. They are good in summer and winter too. Normally I have to go with extra-wide, but with these shoes the normal widths (D) are comfortable â€“ you've just got to wear them a day or two to break them in and then they are GREAT.<br/><br/>That's my experience, but I guess everybody's feet are different. Not everybody has wide, hard-to-please feet like mine."
"I'm normally a Payless BOGO shopper but decided to spend a bit more and hopefully get a better quality shoe. These are excellent well worth the money which still isn't that much compared to what other prices are. Super comfortable great super, great non slip and gripping soles for hiking. You feel really secure on dirt paths with lose rocks and climbing over boulders. My calf's felt like they got a workout just from my feet being supported and the shape of the soles. Great for daily wear and definitely a great hiking shoe. They are breathable. And you don't need thick socks to be comfortable."
"As always with Asics, the pair fit perfectly!  As a walking shoe, these provide exceptional support surrounding the entire foot.  Unlike other shoes which have cushioning at only the sole, these ""surround"" the foot in support and comfort.  I recently purchased two pairs of a low-end shoe at a box store.......two weeks later, threw them out!  My feet felt ""flat,"" for lack of a better term; there was practically  zero support.  Will purchase again and would recommend."
"These are excellent shoes. Have been buying Asics repeatedly and have never been disappointed. They are consistently good quality.<br/><br/>I worked on my feet for years, both standing and walking. My feet hurt so bad I got in trouble for sitting while working at my computer, and I cried after I was required to stop doing that. My secret for comfortable feet: Buy shoes that are longer and wider than my actual shoe size. The last time I was fitted for shoes, I was 10 and 1/2 D. Now I buy Asics 14 4E. They don't flop around on my feet like you might think, and they are perfectly comfortable. Shop around on Amazon for good prices on a good product!"
"These are pretty great trail running shoes. They are thick but flexible, light yet durable, and most of all very comfortable. I thought saving money might decrease the quality of Asus shoes, but these are still better then most other brands at the same price.<br/>I went from an old pair of ua spine shoes to these, and I was really unsure because I loved how flexible and light my shoes were at the moment. These have the same flexibility, but they are much more heavy duty. They are just a bit heavier then my previous pair, but you don't notice it much after a mile."
"These are great shoes! My kids love them. They are supportive, yet flexible and supportive.  I bought two pair, one for each of my sons, and they've practically lived in the shoes since they arrived.  I purchased them in a larger size, of course, and a different color than their last pair, but  these are identical to the shoes they wore previously.  We looked around for better shoes, or a better bargain, but wound up once again with these. It was a good decision."
"I was disappointed with the roughness of the shoe comfort level. It felt too stiff, and one left side felt tighter than the right shoe. After running, and breaking them in; I appreciated the stiffness the shoe provided. To me, it felt like it gave your foot more protection from twisting your ankle when traversing the field, or concrete when running. It broke in and became more comfortable.  So far, a very well made shoe. It just takes time to break in."
"Not as comfortable, or as ""breathable"" as other shoes I've had in the past. My feet are sweating pretty bad after less than an hour of wearing."
great fit and comfortable right outta the box. didn't get the new shoe pain when your foot is adjusting to the shoe.its also light and keeps my feet from tingling by the end of day. on concrete all day bought a second pair just to have another when they stop making style
"So far so good.  I have had them for about a week.  I ordered size 10 the size I usually wear for most shoes.  They fit great.  They seem durable and are very comfortable.  I have run in them several times and they feel great.  I will say they felt a little stiff when they came in but I just wore them for a day or so and they broke in well.  I would purchase these again assuming they stand the test of time, which has yet to be seen."
"I have put these shoes through the ringer over the past few months, and they have done the job. Taking them walking, camping, mountain biking (they got filthy), and other outdoor event. The comfort was more then I expected. Had heard good reviews on Asics and now I understand why. For the price you pay you get a hell of a shoe. Many hours on the feet and not once have I experienced an ache or pain. Even though they are walking shoes, I use them for other outdoor activities and they continue to impress me."
"Best shoes I've ever run in honestly. Active duty calls for a decent amount of running and with other shoes I would get shin pains, with these it is minimized an extreme amount and what I find amazing. Is how light yet nicely padded these are. They fit well on my feet and I ordered them in a half size lower than my nikes but if you want advice go to a store and try on 3 or so different pairs and then make your decision on here."
"These shoes are narrower than my other ASICS, but for me that is a good thing as I have a narrow foot, but if you were expecting the shoes o be as wide as the other models you could be disapointed. Overall I like the ASICS shoes , this is my fifth pair."
"My son just returned from Pico Duarte, the highest peak in the Dominican Republic and all Caribbean Islands. The challenge involves different kinds of terrains, plus the unpredictable tropical weather, with temperatures raging between 2 to 0 Celsium degrees (26 degrees in daytime when arriving at the starting point in La CiÃ©naga town, and 0 degrees at the top of Pico Duarte), Wind,sun, cold, rain, lots and lots of mud, rocky paths slippery with mud and rain, and the beautiful tropical forest everywhere... Going up, then down, all day long. He walked about 60 kilometers, distributed more or less evenly in three days.<br/><br/>All that said, now what you need to know is that my son absolutely loves his shoes! He told me they are very light, dried quickly, and were comfortable.He also told me that he is still wondering how these shoes got though all what he did to them, and came out of this rough test almost perfect! (the rubber at a little part of the tip of one shoe will need a bit of glue to be good as new). At one point, when coming down from one of the many mountains, there was a lot of mud in the rocky path. He was more or less Â¨skatingÂ¨ downwards, because he was tired and he just didn't care what happened to the shoes, as long as he got to the bottom (where the camp was) soon. Afterwards, when washing the mud away, he was surprised to see no damage was done to the shoes!<br/><br/>It was raining almost all the time, so he just put his shoes near the fire they built every night, and in no time the shoes were dry again. He had another pair of shoes, just in case, but didn't use them because they were not as comfortable and light as his new shoes.<br/><br/>He also told me that he noticed the shoes somehow repelled the huge amounts of mud they were supposed to be caked in. When the shoes were too full of mud inside and everywhere, he just took them in the river and washed away the excess. He was so glad to have these excellent shoes for this trip. Many of his friends had heavier shoes, tenis or boots, and not as comfortable, and they had blisters from day 1. My son told me that he got through the hardest parts of the trip, and had not even one blister (he was using one number up from his normal size, but the strain of the rough paths were enough  to damage shoes and feet alike, and my son got away from that with his feet intact!)."
Very happy with these running shoes; although I do not run; I walk. The first time I had a chance to use them I went on a 6 mile walk. I walk mostly on sidewalks and pavement with the exception of a one mile trail around the lake. It has performed very well on these surfaces. I have had no blisters or other problems. The shoes were very comfortable. I cannot think of any cons to speak of. I would recommend these shoes to those who walk.
"Bought the wide size.  Extremely comfortable.  Fit same as my other ASICS running shoe. Good support.  Insole comes out so you can wash, or use different inserts.  I have an orthotic insert under mine.  Will be buying another pair for backups."
"I put a lot of miles on my running shoes and typically use them until they're too beat up to take another step. I have been using this pair since I received them on October 20th, so they are still pretty new. I run about 5 miles a week. I find this pair to be quite supportive, which I like, but they have little cushioning. I can feel a good amount of impact with each step. Typically when I try on shoes in the store, I opt for the pair that feels like I'm running on clouds. Aside from that, they breathe and are pretty lightweight, but most importantly - they fit well. These are good for forefoot running.<br/><br/>I will continue to buy from Asics, but in the future I will go to the store instead of ordering online. I like to know exactly what I'm getting, and that is not easily done when ordering online."
Decent 40 dollarish shoe from a brand I've learned has a longer lifespan than most of it's competition.  The ones they replaced were over ten years old.  The difference now is in build quality but I can't complain because this Asic's predecessor was over 5 years old.  Definitely a casual walking the dog type shoe.  Not really form fitting enough for running. Your feet would shift around in them too much.
I just started running again recently. I used Nike Air's(received as a gift) and had a lot of pain in my leg. I could run a few miles with my ascis 2110's but not with Nike.Since they were well rated and expensive I though its probably because I put on some weight.<br/><br/>Finally I decided to get ascis again. Man I could feel the difference instantly. I ran 5.4 miles on day one with them and NO LEG PAIN the other day.<br/><br/>I would definately recommend these shoes to any one that needs Arch support.
"I bought these for my 16 year old son about 7 months ago to use for gym each day at school. They have pretty intense workout days that cover everything from running and boot camp style training, to days where they lift weights. These shoes have held up to a school year of use and abuse and have kept up with everything that's been thrown at them. They've been a great pair of workout shoes for him."
"Look, I was so excited to get these shoes. When I tried them on they were comfortable, fit great and I liked the look of them. After about 2 months of wearing them the rubber soles started to separate from the foam-ish cushioning. This does not occur on the inner part of the shoe. If you look you will see that the rubber is molded and glued up over the sides of the foam cushioning on the inner part of the shoe unlike the outer side where the rubber is only adhered flat on the bottom. Anyone who plays any kind of sports what-so-ever will wear these shoes out in a week or two. I run with other asics shoes but used these for disc golf and casual walking. These shoes were the most disappointing purchase for me because I love to brag about how great asics shoes are. These were of very, very poor quality and I am blown away by all the positive reviews on here, I am truly blown away. Don't buy these shoes unless you plan to only walk on carpet floors. If you are then great, they'll make great house shoes. Hopefully someone reads this and doesn't waste their money."
"I've been wearing ASICS for over 20 years and always loved them and I had never had any problems with them until this pair. The left shoe fits like a glove, as has every other pair of ASICS I ever owned but the right shoe felt different from the first time I put it on. Something about the back of the shoe just has never felt right and it developed a hole the size of a dime within the first two weeks of very casual wear. The shoes still looks new on the outside but the rub on my heel from the hole makes me not want to wear them anymore. I may give ASICS another try but this pair has been a big disappointment."
5 Stars after wearing them for two days. The fit is so comfortable. Then again I did listen to some reviewers and bought one size larger and got one size larger for my feet. I think I could have stayed with my normal size of 10.5 and would have fit fine.  For long distance running it would be ok to buy one size larger.  I think they are a little heavy for marathons. The treads can be for trail walks and jogs.
"One of the shoes hurts my feet because the arch support is in the wrong place. I wore another pair of ASICS shoes while I worked and I did not wear these shoes for a couple of months. I didn't notice the problem until it was too late to ask for a return.<br/><br/>I work a new job where I am in contact with the public and I cannot wear my comfy old ASICS running shoes. Those shoes are the best pair of tennis shoes I've ever owned.<br/><br/>I have no feet problems and these are the only pair of shoes I've ever worn that hurt my foot like this. I have dress shoes, boots, and other tennis shoes, and the only time my foot hurts is when I wear this pair. That leads me to believe that it is specific to this pair of shoes.<br/><br/>Next time I will spend $150 on another pair of ASICS because it seems like you really do get what you pay for with these shoes. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my other pair!"
"The only sneaker in 4E that gives enough space to accommodate a large bulky orthotic insert and still have enough space left to feel comfortable. The price is fair, I refuse to pay $150 for a pair of shoes that will be used up and tossed 6 months after buying.<br/><br/>Super comfortable, the only shoes for fussy feet. They last just as long as other brands that cost 3X as much."
"So far I'm loving these shoes.  The size is exactly as I expected. They are very comfortable.<br/><br/>It's taking some getting used to because my previous sneakers were so bad that I have a sharp pain on the ball of my foot.  These shoes don't magically remove the pain, but they are helping the pain slowly fade away the more I wear these and stop using the old shoes.<br/><br/>I haven't run in them yet, but I'm considering a second pair in a different color to use exclusively for running."
"Made well. Do not have any of the problems that others have posted with low ratings with stitching, glue and fabric matching.<br/>Fits a bit large. Find my foot slipping inside despite how tight I tie my laces.<br/>Can't return or exchange it was bought on a lightening purchase.<br/>Lesson learned. Despite the convenience of Amazon, always try your clothes on in the store first."
"These are among the best trail running shoes I've ever used, and have a very traditional footprint with plenty of traction- but still very road-friendly for those who run on both surfaces,The 4E width has a roomy toe box, great stability for technical trail running, yet not a minimalist construction or zero-drop shoe which seems to be in vogue these days. I bought ten pair for $45 each and that's at least $20 off of retail price. The shoe accommodates custom full-length orthotics, including keeping the original shoe insert which offers additional shock absorption. It has a rugged toe stop for rocks, tree roots, etc, and a very straight last. There are many other great features to the shoe I could list, but trust me, as long as shoe weight is not an issue (they are not lightweight but still reasonable), I would buy as many pair as you can before the model is discontinued and you are scrambling for a replacement. They are also terrific just for everyday walking, so I basically live in these shoes. Bravo Asics!"
"This is purchase number two of this same shoe. My husband works for FedEx and runs from 7am to 5pm on his route. He wore these every day for 6 months. His feet started hurting because they were totally shot. Got him this new pair and he is right back to normal. They are durable, comfortable, and we love that they come in 4E width. We will likely by them again in another 6 months."
A terrific buy for an affordable price. I wear these every day when I'm not working. They are incredibly comfy and they hold up well against trails both concrete and dirt whilst running or walking. They fit like a dream. It's not about the years you'll get out of these shoes but the mileage. Believe me when I say you'll get a lot of miles out of these shoes. Asics does shoes right.
"Fits fine.  I bought these to replace a pair that wore our prematurely in the heel.  I have a narrow heel and tend to wear out shoes in the mid-heel due to slippage.  I wear thick wool socks and still have this problem.  These shoes allow lacing to help more than most, but ultimately they still fail at the heel for me.  Other brands much worse, so I bought another pair.  Nice color scheme that doesn't shout."
"I wore these today for the first time. They are great. Through mud, stones, underbrush and cow paddies. The sizing was perfect. I went from a pair of Nikes to these. The Nikes were size 9. My feet have grown and the Nikes were definitely tight. Nothing to do with the Nikes. My feet grew. I'm a growing boy of 66. They told me that your feet, ears and nose never stop growing. Well, either way, I thought half size larger on the Asics. Perfect. If I had done another full size as some people suggest, I would have been able to use them for skiing. Which would have been a huge error. Also I bought some amazing socks that don't color match. But who cares? The socks are Yonovo. In the Quick Dry 5-pack. Incredible choice. I was floatin' in my Asics and Yonovos"
"I wear between a 10 - 10.5 US wide. I ordered the 10.5 wide US size and they fit perfectly. I have only had them about a week, and I've worn them everyday. So far they feel great, and give a lot of support for daily wear. They seem to be well constructed for the price. If these hold up after about a month, I think I will buy another pair in a different color just for options."
"So far these are great. I  love Asics. I have Plantar fascia and over pronate. Asics seem to be the only brand that I can wear all day and walk miles in with no foot pain. I have a pair of Gel Exalt that I love, but after only 3 months the inside heel lining has started to rip and come apart. I am hoping the Gel Venture will be more durable while still offering the same comfort."
"i have personally owned 6 pairs of these over the recent years.  I discovered that asics fit me perfectly so i have not moved away from the gel ventures snce then.  I like the ruggedness of them.  They are great for everyday use , but also good for hiking and trail use.  I currently have two.  one for everyday use, and one strictly for running and my gym bag. nice shoe and they hold up great"
"Super comfortable out of the box! Toe box width is perfect, heel counter grip is very good, not constricting in any way. I have a wider (3E/4E) foot and medium width or slightly narrow heel. Excellent fit!! Did the standard break in period of walking in them for a while, then did my trail runs... First time 40 min, no issues. Following weekend, Sat./Sun., 45 min each day. No soreness anywhere, except the usual from running two days in a row. I typically run 3 times a week, 45-60 min per run, during the summer. When it's cooler/cooler out, longer runs. Looking forward to more time on the trail! Excellent value and comfort. You will not be disappointed!"
"You cannot find better shoes on the market than Asics and this color combo has to be the hardest to find anywhere.  I had a pair of GT2000T and they lasted me 2 years until I finally ran one too many trails.  These shoes are NOT the GT2000 series but have a nice tread and are very comfortable.  People have had issues with the sole coming apart, I carry super glue with me in my car for this reason.  It's happened to me with ALL companies but I've had good luck with Asics in general and these are very very comfortable."
All my shoes are size 10.5. These were just too small. re-ordered 1/2 size larger. We'll see if they fit better when the new size arrives.<br/><br/>Update - 6-16-2017<br/>New shoes arrived today. Size 11 fit much better. Snug fit but that is expected with new shoes. I'm sure they will stretch a bit as I break them in. I would recommend buying these shoes 1/2 size larger than your regular size.
I've been buying Adidas cross trainers for a few years but thought I'd give these a try as I've had positive experiences in the past with Asics and these were being offered at a great price.  They fit perfectly (I'm a solid size 11) and were comfortable right out of the box.  I haven't worn them a lot but they seem well constructed.  I'd recommend giving these a shot!
"These ASICS Gel Venture shoes are very comfortable and are great for rugged terrain, or just outside use.  I would not say that they are for running though, although you certainly could, as they are not heavy.  This is a solid all purpose shoe and the visual design is appealing.  Based on this shoe, I would consider purchasing other shoe designs offered by this brand."
"These shoes are a surprising success for my feet! I have wide feet and have never shopped outside of NewBalance, this was a shoe for running or exercise. It turns out that I prefer these as my daily shoe, just be careful of how easily they stick to the ground. These shoes are grippy but as long as your walking/running you will be fine.<br/><br/>I got 10.5 4E and they fit great. One tip that I noticed when searching for these shoes is that the athletic types can be a bit narrow, but I did not experience that compared to most extra-wide shoes."
Perfect fit..Very comfortable..Cushion is excellent..only downside I would say is Shoe-laces..the material of shoe Lace is so smooth that it loosens up no matter how tightly you tie your shoe laces..in 2 miles run usually I have to tighten my shoelaces 4-5 times..because of that it is sometimes risky to run and also variable grips may damage the leg..so excellent product but need to improve this minor thing..
I order a 1/2 size larger since they didn't have the wide version. These are really comfortable and fit perfectly. I use them for hiking dirt paths as opposed to trail running since my knees don't like running anymore.  I found no problems after a couple of 6 mile hikes. Will update after an up coming trip to Chicago where I hope to get 20 miles a day walking in.
"These shoes were a bit too large, but that's not really my problem with them. I've never had gel for support and I'm not impressed. On the elliptical machine I felt the support give out in patches causing numbness. This happened in maybe 15 minutes of my workout. I changed to a treadmill and something about the fit caused enough abrasion on the inside of my foot to make a good sized blister. Could just be me, but I've not had anywhere as severe issues with any of my previous workout shoes."
I really love ASICS for running but the last several ones I have bought haven't lasted long and started to hurt my feet after several months.  I have an old pair that I love and can run half marathons without problems but the newer ones that I get don't work well with my feet.
"This is my husbands 6th pair of ASICS Gel, he really likes them.  He loves a comfortable shoe at a very reasonable price and he gets that with this shoe!  He does have to replace them about every 6 months, but keep in mind he wears them for everything!  He uses them on the elliptical, wears them during football practices with the JFL team and just for daily activities!"
"I have been of ASICS, but lately the newer styles aren't working for me. I was a huge fan of the Gel Pulse line. Those seemed made for my feet. The Gel Venture 5 has a smaller toe box and narrower fit. The arch support is less than the Gel Pulse as well. I do like these for traveling on airlines. I like the subdued color scheme, so I don't stand out in a crowd."
Bought these shoes and have worn them several times.  I walk 4 miles per day and I have been through a few different shoes.  Some were very poorly made.  Some had very little support.  All were very uncomfortable.  This all changed with these ASICs!  They have it all.  I couldn't be happier.  No blisters... no sore feet... no leg pains due to lack of foot support... I have finally found my perfect walking shoes!!!
"Bought these for trail walking and they are very comfortable, while providing great support. The outsole is better suited to rough roads/asphalt and light trails rather than truly rough trails or hiking so just keep that in mind. They dont have the deep grooves for getting a good grip in rougher conditions IMO. I ordered a size wider than normal as some reviews mentioned they ran small, but I did not find that to be the case. I could have ordered the 2E instead of the 4E and been just fine so I'd say they fit just as expected compared to my previous pair of Asics."
"I had to go up a size to fit my ankle brace following a foot injury and surgery. I also realized that I should have gone up a size sooner, since the other foot fits ok. I got these in 4E to accommodate the brace. I have an older pair of the same shoe in 13 that fits more like a 12. so, in general, I would say this shoe tends to fit smaller than usual."
Great fit. All my shoes are 8's and that's what I ordered. Fit great. Shoes look better than the pictures online. Wore them for 2 days so far. Comfortable no discomfort so far.
"Great shoes.  I love them.  I need a 4 wide and the Asics brand offers this width which fits perfectly.<br/><br/>In addition, the price is a really good and this means it a terrific value for a shoe of this quality.<br/><br/>I walk my dog 3-5 miles  everyday and I need a good pair of shoes.  These shoes required very little break in and are very comfortable.  You can't go wrong with this shoe."
I ordered these to replaced my Gel Venture 4 shoes which will now be my backups. I like this particular model as it gives me support and comfort while either on the treadmill or on the track and the price is reasonable. I purchased these in the Castle Rock/Black/Green color and already have had complements on how good they look by people in the gym.
"Good looking, nice fitting, lightweight and comfortable shoes that I purchased after reading excellent reviews both on and outside of Amazon.  I bought these to use primarily for our international traveling and wanted something that was both a good walking show and a good hiking shoe.  These shoes fit the bill and I'd easily put them in the ""best-bang-for-the-buck"" category!"
"I own a pair of Nike 2014 Air Max sneakers that cost around $150.<br/><br/>I tried the Asics on at a store with the Nike on one foot and the Asics on the other........I could not tell the difference, they felt EXACTLY the same.<br/><br/>For the price......you can not go wrong with these sneakers."
"Earlier I was using a pair of walking shoes (Go Walk 2 by Sketchers) for running. My right leg started aching, so my friend suggested I buy proper running shoes instead of using walking shoes. I didn't think the shoes was the problem behind my leg pain but I still bought these shoes just because they were recommended. And I am extremely happy to say that my leg pain has actually stopped just after 2 uses of these shoes. So, yeah, lesson learned. Running shoes for running and walking shoes for walking. Another corollary is that these shoes do their job, that is provide arch support, really well.<br/><br/>Other than that, they look pretty decent. I am slightly unhappy about the fit -- they fit somewhat small -- but that may be because my shoe size is little more than 7. But size 8 shoes get too big so I have to buy size 7, which end up fitting snugly though not uncomfortably. In other words, they are not the most comfortable pair out there but they do their job well so I'm happy."
"I got the extra wide size because the regular size is too narrow and the wide size was not available in my shoe size.  The shoe fits great length wise but since I had to get extra wide, it is somewhat big, but not too big that it is uncomfortable, and not too small and narrow like the regular size is so overall, I am satisfied with the shoe."
Great price! Great show I got a pair for my Hubby who is on his feet working over 10 hour days on average &amp; his employee who works along side of him then got my dad a pair who also works physically all day. They all three love them! Comfortable light weight rested feet!!  Amazing price for product. I order my Husband a new pair once he wears his out.
"I pulled these straight out of the box and put a 2 mile walk on them the day they arrived.  The fit was perfect and they are very comfortable just like my other Asics.  I have walked a few more times (2 miles each time) and I still love them.  I try to walk daily and I need a good comfortable shoe that is durable.  So far, they fit the need perfectly."
"I love these shoes. I bought a second pair on amazon after picking them out at a local retailer, the fit was identical. The price was a bit better on Amazon. ASICS are the brand I prefer, and I always try shoes on in person before I buy them online.<br/><br/>They are very light and have the arch support I need for my low-arched feet. My arches have not complained after 2 months of training. I run on sand and pavement for 5k 3-4 times a week.<br/><br/>The color I bought blue/orange has a nice contrast but is not too loud. I will update them after a few more months. My old pair is 2 months old without significant wear."
"Even though I ordered my correct size and width, the shoes were a bit narrow.  The sole is comfortable, however, I did have to stretch the shoes so they would fit properly... Additional research by talking with athletes and sales people at local shoe stores, they all have said that ASICS brand tend to run narrow so go up one size in width."
"This is my second time getting this shoe.  They are not the lightest running shoe on the market, but I really like the support that they offer.  I generally have pretty prominent knee pain when running long distance and these shoes have really helped alleviate that concern.  I also used them to backpack 70+ miles in Zion National Park this summer.  I didn't want to use hiking boots because I didn't want a bulky shoe.  These held up phenomenally.  They offered the necessary support and traction but I felt the flexibility for my feet.  Additionally the shoes aired out so well I didn't get any blisters, whereas my girlfriend who had bought top of the line boots struggled with blisters from day 2 of our trip."
"Can't beat it for the money.  4 stars only because the Nimbus is a 5 star shoe in my experience, and this is definitely not a Nimbus.  That said, if you're looking for something with a bit more structure, but that remains friendly to underpronation (especially if you don't mind a bit less cushioning), this is probably the best value out there."
"I bought these for my husband and he loves them. He needed a replacement for his old pair and these fit the bill. The color is just as you see on the pictures and is very subtle. They have good traction, good sole support and they're super comfortable. He loves that the style breathes so he doesn't feel his feet getting uncomfortable."
"My husband used to always wear 12's in shoes, but I showed him how sometimes 11.5 would fit if it was wide enough. I ordered these in 11.5 4E and they fit him very well. He's not picky about shoes, as long as they breathe well and are not brightly colored so he can wear them to the office. So far these have been working great for him."
"Superb. No two ways about it. Just took them out of the box. Wore them and within 5 minutes the ""New Shoe"" tightness went away. Went about my work wearing them and completely forgot that I was wearing them!! So light, and comfortable. Have been an asics fan for quite some time, and it has only become more after this purchase!"
"You should never have to ""break in"" shoes just because you have wide feet. I have a very hard time finding shoes that fit like they should, and many brands are very thin even when labeling a shoe as wide or extra-wide. Mine fit exactly as labeled, straight out of the box. They also seem very well built. I use mine strictly for the gym, but I wouldn't hesitate to use them outdoors regularly either. This is my second pair of Asics; my last pair gave me two good years of service and have been retired to outdoor use. I'm sold."
"These shoes look great and so far have helt up very well.  One ""issue"" I have is that the soles are super thin.  I have plantar fasciitis and was expecting a little more support.  I had a pair of New Balance orthotic supports that I have put in these shoes that work very well.  The other issue is that they don't grip at all on wet surfaces.  Sometimes it feels like I'm on ice when the concrete is wet."
I actually wear an 11 2E  but ordered the 12 4E because I want to wear cushioned socks.  I found that the larger size was a perfect fit so<br/>it runs small and narrower than expected.  I will just have to remember to order<br/>a size larger when and if I order again.  Other than that the shoe is comfortable and easy to walk in.
The Asics 11.5 4E size has been a real plus for me.  I have a wide foot that tends to rub too much in medium (D) width shoes.  The only question I have about the Gel Venture 5 is whether it's going to hold up like the GEL Contend 3 that I have been using thus far.  It is already showing some wear in the shoe lining in the heel area.
"I use these as my go to gym shoes now, and I love them. For years I had been wearing nothing but Nike cross trainers at 3x the price because nothing else felt comparable.<br/><br/>Not only do these fit like the Nikes, they also offer enough support for my plantar fasciitis that I can walk most of the day without too much pain."
I have been buying Asics runnings shoes for approximately 12 years now and find that sizing across different models is very consistent.  I wear a 10.5 and they always fit the same which is greatly appreciated when ordered online.  Shoes look great and have a medium to high arch in them which works perfectly for my foot.  My last pair of Asics lasted 2 years of daily use at work as a nurse.  I expect the same to come from these.
This is the second pair I have owned and they are great. The first pair I bought for golf and softball due to the more aggressive tread. They have held up great considering the punishment they have taken.  This pair I bought for day to day wear since I liked my first pair so much. Good cushioning and great arch support and the 4E are plenty wide even for my foot. I'm a large person and can tell you that they maintain their cushioning better and longer than any other shoe I have ever owned.
"Great trail running shoe that hits many pluses for a travel option:  non-slip soles for hiking trails, subtle color for street-ware with khaki or travel trousers, light-weight, sporty Asics design &amp; outstanding reviews by purchasers on many websites.  The major minus for me is that the shoe length, width &amp; toe-box height constrain my foot.  I had to return the shoe in two lengths because the length, width &amp; toe room were too small.  The 4E (shoe width) I tried at another vendor was VERY wide-- too wide."
We saw this shoes at a store and my husband loved them.<br/>Unfortunately they didn't have his size. We looked in couple more stores and we couldn't find the same model.<br/>So we search online and found and bought them.<br/>We got them a week later but they were just perfect.<br/>The box was inside another box and everything looked great!
"My experience with this shoe is limited to two days I tried to make it work. It didn't work out. The sneakers are way too small very narrow with steeply cut toe box. The size I ordered is my standard size and this is the first time ever I have return shoes purchased online. The shoe also felt poorly padded and flimsy, but I could probably live with that if not for impossibly wrong sizing."
The ASIC'S Men's Gel Venture 5 is extremely comfortable and very light weight. I find that after a full day making deliveries in and out of a pickup<br/>that my feel still are happy at the end of the day and I don't have the feeling that I just have to remove them when I get home. Thanks to nurse Kim for the recommendation
"I'm a big guy, 6'5"" 280lbs, that is susceptible to plantar fasciitis,  I'm also frugal and don't want to spend over $80 on a pair of running shoes.  I did some research to find the best pair of shoes for large runners.  So these Asics came up and for $50.  Let me tell you, they have been well worth the purchase.  I can a shoe is going to work after I put them on and they fit comfortably right out of the box.  Had good arch support and didn't pinch my toes or the balls of my feet.  The tread on the soles haven't worn flat like some other name brands will after a short time.<br/><br/>The one reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that the sole on the inside part of the right shoe came undone after about 7 weeks.  Still a great shoe."
"These running shoes are worth every penny, even though I don't run in them. I am a walker and they fit perfectly without any problems of slipping or blisters. They are very comfortable and the second time I wore them, I walked 7 miles all over Chicago without a single issue.  I just may get another pair but in a different color. You can't go wrong with this shoe."
Love these. First time i tried Asics. Very satisfied with these. They are not so expensive but the quality the fit the everything is ðŸ’¯. Definitely would buy them again. I only wished their clothing wasn't so expensive. For the same money i can buy under armor. For sports clothing i wear champion. Good value good quality nice look.
"I bought these Asics as a gift for someone who is a big new balance fan and who doesn't like the neon  colors on running sneakers. She owns a conservative pair of running NB now and wanted a running sneaker that is comfortable. I looked in the NB line and couldn't find anything that fit conservatively.. So I looked on line and Asics came up not only Top Rated but comfortable and gave me options for a sneaker to fit her needs without the bright colors,.you could walk in and be nice enough to wear with jeans to go out.. Well I gave them to her and she loves them. They are comfortable for walking and standing. They are not loud and can easily be worn for going out to dinner with jeans or everyday use. .the only thing she didn't like is the loop on the back of the sneaker which will not allow your pants sit properly. So all sitting well now as she resolved the Issue and cut the loops off which make the sneaker also look nicer. We will see in time how they wear."
"I wore my new ASICS Running shoes for the first time today! I have a sciatica issue that I'm working through and part of the solution was the use of orthotics. I ordered these shoes a half size larger and I'm glad I did. The shoes fit perfectly! I have a comfortable fit but when I walked my pup this morning I had a squeak in both shoes, bummer. But during the walk, I deduced that it was the plastic of the orthotics rubbing against the sole shoe material. When I arrived home I immediately talked both shoes and the squeak was gone! Silence is golden! I then when to the gym and worked out for an hour and I'm pleased to say that there were no irritations, squeaks or break in challenges. Although they still feel new, a little stiff, they worked out better than expected! I would highly recommend these shoes!"
"UPDATE to my previous post: These shoes are TOO SQUEAKY. Almost everyday I wear these to work (office environment) someone comments about the squeak. I would not buy this particular shoe again.<br/><br/>[Original post: Comfortable shoes BUT really noisy. I've worn them for 2+ weeks and they continue to squeak, loud enough that people in my office hear my coming down the hall!]"
"I loved these shoes at first! They fit great, and I wore them for the first time during a 10K and my feet felt great afterwards! Never had a pair of shoes I didn't have to break in and could run a race right off the bat and be fine in! But during a recent trip, noticed the rubber sole on the bottom was starting to peel away from the tip of the shoe. My shoes are less than 6 months old and have only been used a handful of times. Expected better craftsmanship. Feel great, but aren't lasting like I would expect them to."
"I think this is by far the best running shoe I have ever worn for under $50 bucks. I just went through a $100 pair of Nike's and was considering having my pinky toes amputated. There's no comparison, and I feel duped into thinking I was getting the best shoe with a wing on the side for years!  Well those just hit the trash!<br/><br/>The ASICS shoe is well constructed, down to the laces.  Super comfortable, yet minimal weight.  I can't describe the support, but every step feels like a cushion. Color and size were accurate in the description. 2-day shipping was spot on as they arrived on a Sunday. Today I ran a quick 3.1 miles with no swelling. Simply amazing! I'm now considering purchasing a second pair for backup."
I ordered a pair of these a year ago to help cure plantar fascitis.  They are one of the few shoes I have not had to put inserts for arch support and comfort.  They do not aggravate the PF pain.  I wore them out and even cut them accidentally with a chain saw.  Now they are my work shoes.  I just ordered this new pair for dress shoes.  Five stars.
One of my favorite  pairs of walking / running shows. With these shoes on my surgically reconstructed ankle feels wonderful. I liked them so much I bought two additional pairs.
"Have tried these because of excellent experience with Asics Cumulus which I have used past 10yrs. These are for hiking. A little different fit but after my feet got used to stiffer sole, they are as hoped. Hard to beat the price. Threw out my Merrells and Keens which were highly rated, but I found unsatisfactory for long hikes-too stiff, too hot, not enough room for toes when your feet get hot on 10-12mi hikes.<br/>Order these 1/2 size larger for the right fit. My 8.5 fits nicely in a size 9."
These are really good shoes. Some of the best I have ever bought. But they are the first pair Asics shoes I have bought. Very well made quality shoe. 4 stars for the sizing. They have a very narrow toe box which required sending them back and exchange for half size larger. These fit fine and I like the very much. Fortunately Amazon makes exchanges fairly easy
"Third pair! I stumbles across these on a discount rack a few years ago and figured I'd give them a try and now they are a staple. Comfy, breathable and light. They do have somewhat soft soles that wear down but to be expected from a trail shoe. Nice for walking but solid enough for some moderate hiking too."
"So far seem to be good shoes, pretty comfortable, although not as cushy as I would have thought. I do deliveries all day, and am on my feet intermittently 12-15 hours a day, and even at the end of the day still feel pretty good, much better than some far more expensive brands.<br/>They do run a bit on the small side though, suggest ordering a half size larger than normal, and if you usually get a wide, order the extra wide."
"Ok these are great trail shoes. The grip on the sole feels solid when I am running. The fit is quite nice too. I feel comfortable running through the woods over dirt, sticks, different elevations, gravel, and anything else I encounter.<br/><br/>The shoe itself feel very solid too. Like my foot is well supported."
"I bought these for my busy husband who gave the thumbs up on the colors after seeing them online. He's worn ASICS for years, which makes it an easy and predictable purchase when he needs a replacement. I bought his typical size (9.5M) and he says they feel as good as always. Keep making a quality product and he'll be a loyal customer for life."
I like this particular shoe. I had the same model with a different color in the past so I knew what size I needed. I use them 90% of the time to go on my walks. The last pair lasted about a year so hoping for the same length of wear on this pair. I took them out of the box and went on a 5 mile walk with no hot spots or discomfort.
"I have a hard time finding shoes that i like. I usually just go to the store and try on a few a pairs of shoes until i find something i kind of like. So, when prime day came around, i took a chance and ordered these shoes.This is my first pair of Asics, and I have to say i'm impressed with the fit, toe room, comfort, and how well made these shoes are made. i work 12 hour shifts, and i'm on my feet a lot. So, when these shoes arrived, i laced them up and went to work. The comfort is there, and my feet didn't get sore from the many steps i take throughout the shift. i definitely found a brand that i can trust to go back to and order online again."
"I love the way these shoes look, and the way they feel.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Inexpensive, good quality shoes<br/>Attractive design goes well with shorts or pants<br/>Comfortable all day<br/>Lightweight<br/>Good traction, wet and dry<br/>Fit very well<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>None that I can think of"
Very comfortable and nice looking shoe. I spend about ten hours a day in these and on my feet. They are very light and fit true to size. I only wish the tongues were attached so they wouldn't slide to the sides.
"Good quality build, but SUPER stiff, and actually hurt just walking around on carpet . Going back to New Balance.Also, the ASICS 4E is more like a 2E in New Balance...meaning, still quite narrow. Also, NOT FREE RETURNS. Unlike other Prime items, you have to pay to have the item picked up at your home"
"VERY HIGH INSTEP and VOLUMOUS FEET &gt; 14 /4-E  Usable,  ( unlike MANY )  Hoping they will improve &gt; use less than 5 miles.currently.<br/>A little warm, but WELL BUILT , and U can feel the cushions.  WELL worth Purchase,,,, I HAVE a horrible time with foot wear, and usually use Chicos &gt; 13"
"Disappointed with this. I've been buying Asics for years due to my 12E size. The bottom of the shoe came totally unglued on the right shoe from toe to arch. I had to reglue it. Left show no hint of coming apsrt. Must be a quality control issue, or an end of the line whoops, we're out of glue event."
"Very excellent shoe.  Well cushioned through out the sole.  Runs slightly large in the toe-box.  I wear size 12D (medium) and these shoes were a little wide and maybe just a tiny bit long.  Not enough of a problem for me to return them.  Remember, your foot is going to swell as you run.  Good looking shoe.  I'd buy them again."
"These shoes are great! As a large guy (300 lbs), I searched and searched for the right shoe, to fit right, support my weight and for someone that is borderline diabetic. This model kept coming up on online reviews and searches. I have been wearing these for a couple of weeks now and the pain in my feet (that I was experiencing due to broken down New Balance shoes) has become much more bearable. At times, I feel as though I am walking on clouds!<br/><br/>These are my first ASICS and I really love their construction, their fit and the style. In fact, I purchased two pair, the Silver / Grey / Royal and the Black / Onyx / Charcoal. Time will tell in how they really hold up. To be continued...<br/><br/>Search key words: Fat Guy Man Overweight Obese Diabetes Walking"
"The 14 D was too tight, 14 4E was too large and felt like it would slip right off my heel. Why no in between sizes? a 2E would have been ok with me. I wanted to try Asics out as the NB brand trail runners seem to have gotten tighter and smaller for all the new models. Guess I'll have to keep looking."
they feel great. i needed no sneakers for a trip which was going to include a ton of walking. they fit perfect and i was able to walk all day with them. Especially right out of the box with out breaking them in. im a heavy set guy and i was worried that these would not hold up but they're perfect.
"These are the perfect shoes for any athletic activity. I got these because I needed knew shoes to start training to join the marines. I'm a pretty big guy at 6ft 238lbs. And on top of that I have flat feet. These shoes work great and are quite comfortable no matter what I do. And I've been on 10-12mi jogs and a few hikes.<br/>What I really like about the shoes, how it flexes at the heel when I'm lifting or just in general. The only thing I don't like is when I pull the tongue to tighten my shoes I can't pull it too much or else it pulled up the tip of the shoe."
"Once I received the shoes and tried them on, they were somewhat larger than a good fit and I thought the styling was a little forward for running shoes, the pointy toes in particular.  Also, they were about 2 1/2 times more costly than another brand of similar shoes that fit well and looked proper for their purpose."
"Second pair of ASICS I've gotten, like them just as much as the first pair.  I have some pretty wide feet, so it's nice to find a comfortable shoe that accommodates them."
Probably my 10th pair of Asics over the years. Loved getting the color I wanted. Hate shopping at a shoe store because they are always out of my size. This is the 1st pair of shoes I have ever ordered on line.  Comfortable with this purchase because I wear the same size of these year after year.
"I've got these shoes before, good quality.  However, I went ahead and got M medium 'normal' size which is actually very narrow.  You only have a choice between the 'normal' very narrow or ultrawide for these and other shoes.  The actual medium wide 2E doesn't ever seem to be available for any size."
"I've been committed to ASICS for last 5 yrs, usually good fit and strong support.  This pair fit very narrow in the middle of the foot, but lose in the heel.  After a few months, the inside of the heel has torn and worn thru causing blisters . Although these seemed like a good value - they will only last a couple months - very poor quality (made in China)."
So far has been a pretty good running shoe. I just started running again 6 months ago and am doing 15-20 miles per week. I only wear them whiles running so I can't say how they do as an every day shoe. I ordered the 4E and I have plenty of room. Starting to wear a hole in the liner back by the heels. I am ordering another pair for when these wear out. I have picked up a pair of Mizuno and although they were lighter they just didn't fit as well.
"I found these shoes to be reasonably comfortable, and wanted to like them. However, one glaring issue with them was a rather shallow heel cup which made it impossible for me to comfortably wear my orthotic heal inserts without feeling like my heels would pop out constantly as I walked, let alone ran. The upper seemed reasonably well made and comfortable. The sole looked ok, though I could see the areas that looked like they were ripe for separation of the tread from the sole as commented by others in the reviews. I ultimately returned these because the shoes simply wouldn't be versatile enough for me to wear both without AND WITH my orthotic inserts. Otherwise, I probably would still have them and be wearing them, as they were comfortable when worn without my orthotic inserts, and I thought they looked nice. And they were a good price."
"Crap shoe. The Venture must be the low end quality of Asics because I own three other models (Quantum 360, Kayuno, and GT2000) and these pale in comparison. Not comfortable as they are very stiff. Not cushy enough. I suspect they don't have the same gel as the others I mentioned. Not recommended."
"These Asics Gela Venture 5 are the most comfortable and supportive shoes I have purched, I own three pairs they've went from new, to my work shoes, to my yard work shoes.<br/>I am 6'3"" 20 lbs and I am very hard on shoes and I need a lot of support not to mention that I'm a diabetic."
"I have tried running with work shoes, sneakers, and other shoes but I always ended up feeling some sort of discomfort either while running or after. I figured, OKAY, FINE, buy some running shoes that are actually made for running... and you know what? It was worth it!! :0 I didn't feel any discomfort during or after running, in fact I felt my performance while running was much better! I also use these shoes for working out and it's convenient for walking around and staying active. I personally recommend that if you buy a pair of these shoes, buy a half size bigger than your foot, and make sure that if you have a wide foot, that you buy the wide version, and not the usual narrow version of these shoes. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later."
"Transitioned from the GEL-CONTEND 3 to the VENTURE 5...in my personal opinion this shoe is less comfortable...it has a ""plastic like"" feel to the material resulting in less flexibility and comfort. Overall, not a bad shoe compared to the market, but not the CONTEND 3 in quality"
"My husband was so pleased to get these in the mail! They fit him perfectly and looked slimmer on than I imagined. Very comfortable he wanted to walk all over the house with them, his feet were very thankful!! LOL<br/>Will definitely be buying another pair soon, hubby likes to work outdoors ;)"
Second time in the same year I purchased these comfy shoes.  First time a 10.5 which was a little snug but I made it last for 7 months.  This time I went up to 11.5 and it is a perfect fit.  I am normally a 10.5W so word to the wise when ordering this pair of shoes.  Go a whole size up.  Great buy though.  Use them for work and gym time.  Like I said the first set lasted 7 months!!
"I have tried other brands of running shoes.  I am a fat bastard and wear them for the support, I definitely do not run.  That being said this brand of running shoe is the only one I wore when I was in the Army that did not leave my feet hurting the next day after a long run for PT.<br/><br/>I wear these to walk and work out in.  The ASICS Venture 5 have been my go to sneaker since they came out.  I have had them in multiple colors and just love them.  My wife and son both LOVE the ASICS Venture 5."
"I got these for my son for work as they need all black shoes. They fit perfect, and they're very comfortable for all day standing. (According to him!) I will say, they are not TOTALLY black, but thus far he's slid by with the dark grey/silver on them.<br/><br/>Comfy, and practical."
"Probably the cheapest running shoes I have ever bought (I paid $41). I am not a runner, but my Dad is marathon-level and blows through the more<br/>expensive ($100+)  Asics ""Gel Forte"" T390N shoes like Kleenex. So, I get a lot of his ""hand-me downs"" that are only a few months old, where a very small specific part of the sole is worn down. I wear running shoes whenever I am not at work, and now I have tried out both a Venture and a Forte.<br/><br/>This is a similar shoe. Compared to the Forte, my impression is the Venture is a little ""tighter"". The treads on the bottom are a little more defined so they may grip the road better. They look better than the Fortes in my opinion and after a quick break in period are decently comfortable."
"Love ASICS shoes. Got these Gel Venture 5 instead of Gel Foundation 8, which I've been wearing for years but don't seem to be available in my size now, and they are a good substitute. I like the F8's more as they give a little better cushion but the V5's are great to wear around town."
"Decent cushioning, very good price.  Love that I can get these in size 15 with 4e width.  Asics, please don't stop making big and wide shoes- these are the best comfort options out there for us freaks with big, huge feet."
I like the color/style design. Well made. Good materials and feels durable. The price is very competitive.<br/><br/>However I have to return it as I am looking for something for mostly walking and light running. The bottom is a little stiff for my purpose. Wish I could use it.
Great styling and comfortable. The cushioning is excellent in the heel which is important during long walks. Very good price point.
"I have been wearing these for a month with Doctor Scholl's plantar fasciitis inserts and my feet feel amazing. I forgot what it felt like to walk without pain until I bought these. If you are on a budget and need comfortable shoes, look no further. I wear 13 wide (4e) and they fit great."
"Asics are the only shoe I consistently find fit me well and are comfortable. I looked at similar Asic model in the store, but they didn't have my size. Lo and behold, Amazon had the size and color I wanted for less money than the store. I haven't done any hard running in these yet, but they've had great grip and comfort for the walking and running I've done so far."
"I am a fan of ASICS. First ""sneaker"" I ever put on that were immediately comfortable. While initially designed as an athletic type shoe, their fit and comfort are great for everyday wear. This is the first time I have ordered them online but ordered based on sizes previously purchased and they fit great. Would definitely purchase again through online/Amazon format."
"This is a decent shoe for the money.  The uppers are well made and comfortable once the padding conforms to the foot.  My only real complaints are with the sole.  The first problem is that the sole contains many nooks and crannies that capture pebbles.  Every time I use the shoe outside I come back with rocks stuck in my soles.  This can cause annoying clicking on pavement and scratch floors indoors.  The second problem is that the soles aren't very substantial.  The little triangle features in the center front of the shoe are quickly worn away and underneath them is only about 1 mm of rubber.  I don't think I've ever worn through a sole more quickly than these.  The uppers are barely worn, but the soles are nearly flat in some areas.  A sole with some more meat on it like the old Nike Pegasus would make this shoe a better value."
"I purchased these, along with another pair of ASICS running shoes, and I couldn't be happier. As one who has suffered from extreme foot pain, for most of my 70 years on this planet, I have to say, this particular brand of shoe, has been superior in alleviating the pain, than any of the other brands of shoes that I've purchased over the years. They seem to have excellent arch support, they're light, and have good ventilation to keep your feet cool. Time will tell, how good they really are, and how well they hold up."
"I have bought the Gel series of ASICS shoes for a number of years now, so fitting wasn't a problem.  This time around as I'm getting serious about running again, I went online and researched the best running shoes for big guys like myself.  I was surprised to find this shoe at or near the top of multiple lists I came across.  Great arch support and a soft step, but most importantly, an incredibly light shoe for a size 13 wide!"
"I bought these 6 months ago and they've held up great!  They are still comfortable wearing all day.  Usually at 6 months my shoes or boots are trashed.  These have really surprised me on the quality and price.  I've had $100+ Asics fall apart in this time frame (soles coming unglued), but not these!!!"
"Best shoes I have ever owned. Been working 8 hours a day constantly walking on them for 2 years now and they still are in good condition with barely any rips or tears. Very impressed.<br/><br/>Also great for people prone to get blisters on the bottom of their feet, as the gel acts like a gel sole but built in.."
"These shoes are great for jogging; already have over 500 km (300 miles) on them and expect another 200+ km before replacement. I make sure to have a backup pair in-house well before my current pair wears out.<br/><br/>I also use Powerstep Protech Control Full Length insoles with these, due to issues with my gait. Since I started using these insoles, I haven't had any leg issues."
I'm no pro runner. I want to die just running ONE mile but I'm just trying to make my man boobs smaller and the shoes are helping so far.
"Just finished a six mile break-in walk. Very happy with the fit and construction of these shoes so far. I was a little anxious when I ordered the 9 4E's, as I normally have needed a 9.5 2E in other shoes. However I took the advice from Amazon's 3D recommendations based on my current shoes (New Balance 890 v5's size 9.5 2E.) Amazon was spot on! The 9 4E ASICS fit like a glove right out of the box.<br/><br/>Will see how these hold up as I ease them into my current running workouts (10-15 miles per week mixed road / trail). But so far I am delighted with the purchase."
"If I can be picky...The size chart is good, but this is my second pair of Asics in recent years so I would have to say a little snug and one shoe was a little more snug then the other. I also felt the arch on the one side more then the other. Having said that its nothing worth returning, I loosen the laces a little and they are already breaking in fine. For the money and convienence I am impressed. I will definitely go for another pair."
"I wanted to see how these were compared to the Cumulus and Nimbus.  Clearly you get what you pay for... These are less than half the price, but night and day difference with the fit, feel, and function. I would not recommend them for running or walking any kind of long distance. Go up the product spectrum."
I don't know what exactly wrong with shoes! But after wearing them for like 10 mins ...my right feet start hurting from arch! It's like internal pain due stretch but the left is always okay! I tried 2 different times but same problem...overall shoes look very smart and I think the GEL part is over hyped and these are not really that comfortable
"I just bought a second pair of these sneakers as my first are starting to wear out. These are very comfortable. I have a high arch and found I still need a basic insert, but with that simple addition the Venture 5s are one of my favorite all-purpose sneakers I've ever had."
If you're a runner and you have wide feet these shoes are the best. I run about 4 miles a few times a week and these shoes have held up for quiet some time and are really comfortable. This is my second pair of the same shoe and will more than likely continue to purchase when these start to wear down too much.
"I'm female, size 10.5-11 wide. The Asics in women didn't fit me correctly. I'm inbetween sizes. This men's 8.5 wide fits perfectly. Feels like I'm walking on clouds. Light-weight and flexible, yet supportive. I'm switching from Brooks and New Balance-I've found my new shoe."
"I really like how well they fit and I followed some of the other reviewers advise and went 1/2 a size bigger. The new shoes really look nice with jeans.  Very good quality, just like my last pair (which I did not order from Amazon, they were a gift and I am in for life now)."
"Fits just right. I am used to Nike Shox, so these don't have quite the same support or impact absorption, but they are very light weight, and economical. They don't seem to be the strongest built, but not bad for around the house, which is exactly what I bought them for."
"Bought as a gift for my dad, and he described the shoes as very comfortable, and that they are so lightweight that they feel like they're almost not there at all. He used them at the gym, this is a new addition to his gym collection that is filled with older ASICS that are still in great condition even after years of use."
"I consistently fit an 11.5 in Asics, and these were no different, fitment was perfect. I have very flat feet and many shoes I can't wear for more than 4 or 5 hours, these are remarkably good for the price and can wear them all day. Light weight and seem to breathe well."
"I like to walk around 3 to 4 miles per day but have been suffering from plantar fasciitis. I was hoping for some shoes with good arch support. These have been perfect so far (about 3 weeks of usage). They are comfortable, supportive, and fit perfectly. I'm very happy with the purchase! I'll update the review if anything changes."
"These shoes are nowhere near as comfortable for all-around running (pavement, trail, etc) as the GT series are, but they do what they're supposed to as a trail shoe: the traction is harder, so it handles dirt and rocks well.  However, after a couple of months of use, I took a fall running downhill on hardpacked dirt because of traction loss.  So much for the efficacy of reversed sole tread.  I did better with the aforementioned GT series!  I think that more praxis could go into the design so that the performance isn't just dependent upon theory.  There could be less flex to the sole, too, as my feet wrap around rocks in a way that cause a bit of pain on the trail - something I'd be buying Five Fingers for if I desired it.  Inexpensive shoe, so you've got some compromises.  We'll see how durable the soles are..."
Well firstly I am weight lifter and a runner. That being said here are the pros and cons of these shoes.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. Fits the size you get.<br/>2. Out of the box these shoes feel amazing on the feet.<br/>3. They need almost no breaking in.<br/>4. The grip on the feet feels great on multiple surfaces.<br/>5. Decent color choices.<br/>6. The price on these shoes is great not only for the brand but for the simple fact that your suppose to replace running shoes every 6 months<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1. The laces are to long. I ended up switching them out with the lock laces.<br/>2. You will get blisters in the beginning but after running a couple times your feet will break them in.
"Really like these shoes! I bought two pair. Several 10Ks behind me and like them the more I run in them. Well made. Great arch support. And I like that they run a little long because nothing worse than slamming your toes into the front of your shoes when you run. I also like the tread in that unlike my other two Nike Flex I own, the tread does not pick up rocks forcing you to stop and clear them. I'm a new fan of Asics Running."
"Shoe fits &amp; feels fine, so 4 or 5 star for that. However, all the light grey color is so very much darker than in the picture. So much darker I had to check that the model number on the box &amp; shoe tongue was correct-it is correct. T5N3N.1314 Light Grey/Graphite/Red."
"one of my favorite sneaker brands. I was glad to see i could by this on amazon. I need sneakers that have an indent on your heal and these are great for just that. I use these to exercise but they look great, If you want to just walk around they are light and comfortable all purpose. I would not recommend these for winter since they are clothe."
"A bit disappointed with the comfort of this one.  It's my third recent pair of Asics, and I am very impressed with the previous ones (Gel-Craze and Gel-Sonoma).  They are both candidates for the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned.  This is about the 4th day for these Gel-Venture, just for daily wear not running, and I sense a problem with the knobby sole pushing on the bottom of my foot, thereby reducing comfort.  This one is labeled a ""running"" shoe, so maybe that's my mistake.  The Craze and Sonoma are in the ""trainer"" category and have a flatter sole.  I'm gonna to look for ""trainers"" from now on.  If this improves over the next few weeks, I'll update the review."
"These are among the best shoes I've ever had. this is my second pair,even though the first pair I bought a couple of years ago are not quite ready for the trash bin yet. I'm thinking of buying another pair for future use. my foot is wide and these really accomodate."
I have been buying a different brand for almost twice the price. I bought these and they were to small. I sent them back for a refund and ordered the next size up. They fit good now and are comfortable. I walk five miles  everyday at 3.5 mph non-stop and was so happy with these I ordered a second pair. Time will tell how long they last.
"After trying all of the leading major brands of running shoes over the past 30-40 years, I recently stumbled across the ASICS line about 3 years ago.  From my first pair to this pair, they are the most comfortable and best fitting running shoes that I could ever ask for."
Really comfortable because I'm on my feet 12 hours a day and they keep my feet comfortable and no pain at the end of the day.
"I've always worn Asic's, they're great shoes that fit me and are comfortable. This is the first show by Asic that I thought did not meet my expectations of a walking/running shoe. The sole was stiff and not very well cushioned. I walk adn run trails and the tread was well designed but the flex was stiff and my feet tired after a few miles due to lack of impact protection.<br/><br/>They're neat everyday shoes, comfortable enough for wearing when not exercising and I'll keep them for that purpose. And, if you want to sacrifice comfort for stability on the trail, I suppose they can work for that too; they are stable but just not flexible or cusioned enough for my style of trail running."
"I followed Amazon's size suggestion and the fit was perfect.  These are great for walking and everyday use. Nothing out of this world. They do their job. I walk a lot so I wear shoes pretty fast. It's great to know I can just reorder, without worrying whether the size would be correct or not."
"These shoes have held up well so far running twelve miles a week for two months.  I'm very much a novice runner and I've never bought ""Running Shoes"" before but these have been a pleasant experience and I would recommend even with my admittedly limited knowledge."
"Well, Asics always give me the perfect match between comfort and style. This shoes are excellent to walk to my work and use in casual occasion."
"Started experiencing plantar fasciitis so I purchased these for additional support. To soon to give it a 5 star as I've only had them for a short period of time. I would like to mention that the sole has many small crevices that while good for traction, will carry dirt/sand into the house more so than other shoes."
I bought these shoes to wear as my everyday after work pair. Fit is comfortable and they look good. Flash forward about 3 months and the shoes begin making a noise when I walk. A squeaking noise with each step. Both shoes. The noise is so problematic that I feel like George on Seinfeld with his whooshing pants. I'm considering buying a different pair of shoes because of the noise. I may try to record a video that captures the noise and update my review.
"I've been using vibram five fingers shoes to run for the past 4 years. During that time, i was running about 3 or 4 times a month but since the new year i've been running 3 day/week. I'm usually wear a 10.5 and these fit but they're a little tight. I ran in them for 3 miles a couple days ago and they felt nice. Every step/impact felt comfortable because of the gel inside. I really need to get used to buying running shoes again but not bad overall."
"Awesome! The color combination is great and they as comfortable as a shoe can be.  I only wear these to walk when I travel because I tend to spend a lot time by foot, and they are a relief.  Much better than other sporty brands!<br/>These size actually is correct on the length, and because of previous experience, I selected a wider factor and it fits perfect.  Keep that in mind!"
"Great shoe apart from the fact the laces broke within one week of normal use on my trip to Cuba where you can't buys shoe laces,  hence the 2 stars. Always held asics to a high standard until now. Shoes seem to be holding up., just cheap crappy laces let them down."
"My previous pair from several years ago was fabulous. This pair shows the exact same specs but is narrower. I've tried to make do but they just aren't as comfortable, so I need to decide whether to jump to a wider one or another brand."
"Asics Men's Gel-Venture 5 are great fitting, long lasting, wide based shoes with excellent support. I walk 5-6 miles a day, or hike 3 miles through rocky terrain. These shoes help with stability and have enough cushioning and tread to keep you safely on the trails with no foot or joint pain. Highly recommend!"
"For some reason ASICS shoes seem like the most comfortable fit for my feet.  Also, I had an odd accident a few years ago and really damaged a large toe, ASICS are the only shoe that makes that toe feel just right.  This is the first time that I tried a running shoe and with this particular type of shoe from ASICS the shoe size is a tiny bit on the large size. Otherwise spot on."
I have bought my husband a couple pairs of these and he loves them. They fit his feet perfectly.<br/>He's been working outside in them a lot and is wearing his other two pair. And wants some. Ew ones<br/>This pair is a gift for our upcoming anniversary.
I bout the Light Grey / Graphite / Red ones size 13. I am 240#. First want to point out how the light grey looks almost tan in the picture but is  light grey in color as stated. This shoe is my light off pavement primary shoe. It is easy to clean and dries fast. Mud cleans off easy and does not build up to bad when walking. lose deeper sand and traction is just ok but it climes sand stone very well. I could if necessary walk in these all day on pavement but the traction on these shoes will wear out faster than other styles for just pavement. Traction is very well suited for spirited walking on dirt and rocks. I only lightly jog in these on occasion mostly fast walking and light climbing. I will buy these again probably the light blue ones for verity before these even get close to wearing out.
"I purchased these for my dad for his birthday and he loves them. I'm always nervous purchasing clothing items online, but these shoes run true to size. My dad thinks they are very comfortable. He loves asics shoes.<br/>They look great and are well made."
"After reading reviews on these shoes, I decided to order them a half size smaller than what I normally wear. When I first put them on they were tight, but they stretched well and fit perfectly. I use these four days a week. For both cardio and strength training. I love the color and I love the feel. They are a little narrow, but fight through that at the beginning and they will stretch and fit better. I wore them around my office at work all day one day (I get about three miles of walking in a day at work just around the office) and then started working out in them. I love them. I would recommend these to anyone. Only negative is some of the threading has started to come apart, but has not affected their stability or function since it's up near the front of the tongue."
"The shoes fits well, I run about 4-6 miles 5 days a week and these shoes have been pretty good. Shoes offer plenty comfortability and good support. I'm feel happy with my purchase over all due to price and feel of the shoes. My only complaint is the quality control, some parts of the stitching aren't perfect, even the cut-out designs on the heel meaning just cosmetic design imperfections. Other than what I mentions you do get what you pay for and maybe a little bit more with this one so 3/5 fair as can be."
Arrived in good condition.  Fit as expected.  I have been wearing Asics for numerous years and have not been disappointed.<br/>Amazon Prime service has let me down lately: items ordered on Thursdays have not been delivered until the following Monday.
"I tried it on in store and seemed to fit fine but the pair I got in the mail seems larger.  It does not fit like the 2100 series which I have had for years.  Very uncomfortable for my particular foot after wearing, the soul is not cushiony and the shoe overall is too wide. I tried a more supportive soul and the soul it too short and does not reach the top of the toe which rubs on my toe."
"This is my second pair of the Gel-Venture trail shoe. I use this shoe on combined paved street-paths and trails on the California North Coast. My current pair is beginning to wear at the corner near my small toe, otherwise the uppers are still in great shape. The inserts are completely worn down and soles are still good. I've worn many ASICS shoes for several years now. I'm size 8 and ASICS shoes do run a little small as noted on websites and reviews so I wear the size 8.5 normal width. Good fit in the toe box. A very good utility shoe without spending a lot of money and the shoe holds up. Kevin Metcalfe"
"Dude...  this is like my 20th pair of Asics.  Been wearing this brand since 2004 and have never looked at any other brand.  I have worn Brooks, Adidas, Reebok, Nike just to name a few and Asics are the better shoe,  for me and my feet anyway. You just need to find what fits your hoof and stick with it."
"I ordered these shoes a couple of weeks ago, i bought the carbon, black, hot orange design, the shoe is very comfortable and light but BEWARE! because the sole of the shoe is made from rubber it can be very slippery and can potentially result in injury if you run or walk during rainy weather, since i couldnt go outside i tried working out indoors but as soon as you start to sweat and that sweat hits the floor you'll find yourself sliding across the room like Tom Cruise in that dancing scene from Risky business, another problem is the lack of ventilation causes the shoe to smell if you wear it for too long, my feet dont smell when i wear any of my other shoes."
"ASICS are perfect for me because I wear a 13, but a big 13, ASICS EURO size for this shoe is a 48, which is just a little larger than other manufacturers 13""s, which run 47 - 47.5 in EURO. Just that little bit make all the difference in the world."
"Nice shoe but I replaced the laces w/Lacelok rubber stretch laces for my own idiosyncratic whim,so sue me. But it neatened them up and gives me a slip on/off ease.Also the stretch laces lock a perfect snugness in,making for a very good tight bounce.For real."
I've been wearing the Gel-Equation but decided to try this. So far it seems great. Seems a bit more sturdy. Fit is the same and it has the same removable insole to accommodate orthotics though the factory insoles are very comfortable. Good value too.
"I bought these because a previous post said he orders them for work.  I must say I agree, I am always on the go at work and this pair of shoes are nice.  I am sure there are other pairs that might be better, but knowing what I know these are at least better than my last pair."
I am extremely happy with this purchase.  Actually this is the second set of these shoes I have ordered.  I liked the first pair as they were comfortable and wore well.  These fit well and looked good and the price was about half of what another brand cost for a comparable shoe.
If money wasn't tight I would have purchased another pair of GEL-Nimbus shoes.  Much more comfortable and better support.  Though you can't complain when these are half the price.
"I do wedding photography and videography so I'm on my feet all day and on the move constantly. I needed a shoe that is durable and comfortable and I found that with this one. Usually, I'm having to put get insoles or deal with the shoe just not holding up but these shoes have been solid so far and they don't kill my feet."
"I honestly think Asics are the only shoe I can buy on the internet and know they're going to fit beautifully...NO surprise, they came today and feel like I'm walking on a cloud. A VERY high quality shoe under 50 bucks!<br/><br/>Buy this shoe, you won't regret the decision."
I ordered these for my husband. He typically wears a 9.5 in Nike. Ordered a 10 in Asics and he loves them! He can wear them all day without fatigue to his feet. He is constantly on the go and walks four miles a day in addition to his busy job. Will definitely reorder once he needs a new pair!
"Fairly attractive, light-weight shoe that is not too hot.  Tread is not too prone to slipping on trails or wet sidewalks during walks, and though perhaps not the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn, they are certainly enough so that I'd order them again."
"So far so good....nice looking...reasonable price....purchased for 3 mile exercise walk...very comfortable so far...would recommend.....used to purchase/run in Asics years ago and was never disappointed...nothing has changed, they still make a very good product."
I found these sneaker to be somewhat uncomfortable. after wearing them for a couple of hours my feet hurt sufficiently enough that I had to stop what I was doing to change them off for another sneaker. Would recommend purchasing a wider size.
"Nice shoes.  I've worn NB shoes for years and these were a bit cheaper so I figured I'd give them a try.  They fit good and are really nice after having the same pair of shoes for years.  Nothing against NB, either.  Nice to have options on shoes.  maybe these will last as long too..."
"Well fitting shoe. With Asics, I always have to order a half size up. Wore them part of first two days and full time after that. Ordered them for walking trails and they keep me from slipping on the trails. Would definitely buy this shoe again. Only reason I took one star off was that they don't  have quite the same cushion as their expensive models."
"Great shoes for someone with bad knees or ankles. I have two pair of this, one in gray and blue the other in black and gray they are so comfortable that I bought this for my dad and he loves them. Will be ordering more as I need them. Thnaks"
"I dont wear these any longer, they never broke in and softened up like all my other asics. I paid more for my others , maybe this is why the flexibility is so poor that I just put them away. Goodwill here they come, no more 40$ asics for me"
I ordered this pair because they had the most reviews. but they are kinda too large and Heavy compare to some nice running shoes. they work fine for inside gym or for some outside workout. i am not an expert runner but I would order another pair for a long run.
"Padding was very thick initially, but after a couple weeks of wear they fit quite well."
"Very comfortable and seems to be the correct width.  My only issue is that the toe box feels a bit too spacious.  Very comfortable and no blisters.  These are my first ASICS, so maybe they run just a tad looser than other brands I have worn.  I might try the 2E instead of 4E next time to see."
Very good shoe for the money. I have wide feet at the ball of the foot and Asics is my go-to brand. These shoes are well made and are holding up as expected. Also like the style and color as they go with most any casual clothes I might wear.
"I am really happy to have found some great alternatives to the $130 shoes I have been buying. I grabbed 2 different pairs (colors) of these and really love both of them. They replace Brooks Cascadia 10, and although 2 different types of shoes, the comfort is what I was going for. With 2 pairs of these, I am still up over $30."
"I normally buy shoes in-store so I can try them on and test the fit, but for $49.99 I figured I could take the risk. ASICS are my favorite brand of shoe because they're made well, they fit well, and they last for a long time. The pair I received were exactly what I was hoping for, and I know they'll last a good year or so like my last pair. Then again, they might not be right for you; I'd recommend visiting a local running store if you're unsure, and they'll likely have someone there who can evaluate your running style and determine what would be best within your budget. If you like ASICS shoes, this is a good pair of ASICS shoes."
"These are absolutely great running shoes. I log about 20 miles a week, which isn't yet an unreasonable amount, and these shoes have held up to the wear and tear of everything I have thrown at them. They have gone through mud and salt water and come out just fine from the wash. The soles still hold up great and the arch support is still fine even after a year of consistent running. I am sure at some point these shoes will wear out, and when they do I will be right back here ordering another pair. I already ordered a pair for my girlfriend who I am getting into running, and immediately her mileage this past week is way up with less pain and injury. Highly recommend these shoes."
"Great running shoes!  Very comfy, looks stylish for even everyday wear paired with black socks.  Good cushion when doing some heavy runs, hopefully it holds up for at least a year, definitely a keeper.  ASICS always have the runners in mind!"
This was my first online shoe buying experience and I can say I am very satisfied. The shoes look good and have a solid build quality. There is a lot of support at the heal and arch of this shoe that makes you feel like you could stand or walk in these shoes for very extended periods of time without any issue. Another big plus for me is not paying an arm and a leg for a new pair of tennis shoes. This is because (and I don't know if it's the way I walk or what) I tend to go through shoes pretty fast. Some last 2 years some last 6 months. I'll be even more impressed if these end up lasting more than a year for the low price I paid.
I've owned these for over one year. This is my second pair. I don't run. I use them for walking and everyday use. I find them so comfortable I forget I'm wearing them. I also use Lock Laces so slipping them on and off takes one second. Love 'em.
"I broke my own rule of not going cheap on jogging sneakers, and well, thats the problem.<br/>I think these are ok sneakers, specially for going to the gym and running treadmill but i do not recommend these sneakers for anything over a 10k.<br/>I just took these out on a 12k run and man, my feet are in PAIN. They also feel heavy.<br/>They seem well built but honestly you get what you pay for.<br/>Again, if you need sneakers for basic working out in a gym or a treadmill or maybe do weights, these are a great affordable option, but if you plan on jogging anything over a 10k I would highly discourage you from getting these."
"giving this a 3 because it is clearly nowhere near as comfortable as the Gel-Nimbus or Gel-Cumulous, but then again you get what you pay for and getting the more expensive line of Asics is definitely worth it if you have bad feet."
"I'm on my feet all day with work these are the 2nd pair of these I've used and I have legitimately loved both of them. Lasted a little over a y ear on the first pair (bought in July lasted until October the next year) with a lot of use, I work anywhere from 8-14 hours a day on my feet for most of it and they were my primary ""running around"" shoe so they saw a lot of wear in the year it took them to wear out."
"So far, so good. I bought two identical pairs; one for general use and one for work/school (I work at a hospital and am a nursing student). They're very comfortable and breath well...I get sweaty feet and these are great so far."
"Just as the gel venture 3s that I used to own, ASICS has made another shoe that fits perfectly with incredible comfort on and off the trails. These shoes have gone from being just my running shoes to being what I wear all day. As long as ASICS keeps up what it's doing here they'll have a repeat customer in me."
"Extremely comfortable...  I had bought another model 6 months ago that gave me a black toe that I am still recovering from.  When you buy a pair of Asics make sure you know your size (with Asics) and that you know which model suits your needs and the shape of your feet.  Apparently Asics shoes are not all made out of the same factory, and knowing your size only is not good enough to make it the perfect fit and purchase.  I knew this model had served me well in the past, so I purchased the Venture model which I knew was likely to be a good fit... And bingo! Perfect fit at half the price of brick and mortar stores."
"I usually buy specific shoes with a wide toe area so that I don't lose my second toenail after running. I love shoes with a wide toe area, but they are typically more expensive and last about the same duration as many other shoes. It always seems like I am going through shoes really quickly.<br/>  The Asics were recommended for people needed a little more room at the front of the foot. So I figured I would give these a try. These shoes feel much sturdier than I was expecting. They are light weight which is nice for longer duration walks/jogs. I feel very stabilized when walking. The Venture 5 also provides excellent cushioning. I'm very happy with these Asics."
"I use this while working and according to my Apple Watch, I range about 10-12 miles a day.  It's been about six months, it shows it's wear and tear but it's still going.  I had to change the insoles eventually but still goes."
I couldn't be happier with this pair of shoes - so much that I just ordered a second pair. I use them mainly for walking and at the gym. The fit is perfect and they are well cushioned.  I like the detail of the tab at the back of the shoe to hang them in the locker or to grab while putting them on.
I have been buying New Balance for a number of years but have been a little disappointed lately with the quality. My daughter recently bought a pair of ASICS and they seemed really nice so I thought I'd give a pair a try. I'm really glad I did. This is a great shoe for the price. As soon as I put them on I could tell that I was going to keep them. They give good support and are lightweight. I don't know yet about durability but I guess time will tell.
Great looking shoe. You can feel the support right off the bat. I ran 4 miles in my other shoes yesterday so Ill test these out on Friday and see how they do. I'm wearing them now at work and so far so good. I did adjust the laces because I had some serious pressure on the sides but it seems to have gone away since adjusting. I will provide an update after my run on Friday.
"I've worn nothing but Asics for 40 years (not including dress shoes, of course).  These shoes fit perfectly and if they're like all of my other Asics, they'll last me several years.  Excellent quality."
"Of all the Asics shoes I've bought, these are my least favorite so far. Perhaps because the pair I received was slightly wider and longer. They do appear to me to well constructed and will probably hold up better than the other pairs I've owned. But I'm not sure I'll be wearing them that long because I find them to be not as comfortable as I'd like. (I work on a concrete floor and walk many miles a day so I need a super comfortable shoe and these do not meet that expectation.) Personally will not be ordering another pair. Perhaps I need to look at other brands....This is just my experience so please take them as such. Your mileage will probably be different."
"Good shoe for the price.  Comfortable and nice looking. Have not used long enough to evaluate ruggedness or overall sustained use quality.  So far,  so good.  May rise to stars based upon continued performance under use."
Love these running shoes.  Because of some knee problems I cannot run as before but these suffice for walking and the occasional run off road.  I would not use these for serious running but they are great for my purpose.
"Needed a pair of everyday walking shoes, those had great reviews and the price was just right.<br/><br/>As for the fit, compared to other brands I've tried, those have ALOt of padding around the outside of the shoe. Not as noticeable after walking/running for about 10 miles, but those are also considerably warmer. My feet sweat a lot, and this just made the matter worse. Comfort is good, I like the sole and this has good rock protection on trails as well. I got a size 10 and it feels a little snug, this might improve with time as they break in a little.<br/><br/>I love the color and the look on those. I got the orange ones, and they look great!"
Normally 10.5 is a bit too narrow but these are snug and fit perfectly. Great quality shoe for the price.
"Light weight, fit perfectly ,sometimes a 14 is too big but not this one!"
"Great product and price. Worn them now for a couple days, one being in Chicago and going to the jimmy Buffet concert and they have great support and are comfortable. I plan to make these my new walking shoe and for the price getting another pair soon."
"Nice looking and comfortable, but a couple months into wearing these and I hear a squeak from the sneaker sole that is quite loud. Both make the noise when I walk, but the right one is much worse. Obviously, defective sneakers and inconsistent with a quality name company. They are out of the return period, so I am quite disappointed. ASICS should be informed as I would think they would also be disappointed. I will stop ordering footwear on Amazon due to this issue."
"Please note I am a serial ASICS user.  Fit is great.  Shoe has been in use for about 6 weeks.  Plenty of cushion for moderate (5-10 miles) hiking, walking or even running a couple miles on black-top.  Not enough sole firmness for hiking on walnut size jagged gravel.<br/><br/>I would have rated the shoes four or maybe five stars but the mesh turned from gray to red or purple from either too much sun, getting wet or residual bug repellent mist.  Never experience that before with an ASIC or any other shoe.  I missed the return window by 17 days.  Dang!"
These shoes fit as expected I used them as an all around runner. Thanks amazon
"Great shoes, especially for the low price.  I bought a pair of $115 ASICS running shoes two years ago on Amazon and I cannot really tell the difference between how they feel and these. They will be used mainly for casual walking."
"This is the third pair of these sneakers I have bought and I've been very happy with them.  I'm a nurse and my job means that I'm on my feet a lot.  This means that I need a comfortable sneaker.  These sneakers keep my feet comfortable for an entire twelve hour shift.  I also have another pair that I use at the gym.  They are also very good for jogging on the treadmill and I've noticed that since I started wearing them, I've less of a problem with shin splints."
Im not a person who buys a lot of shoes  because it would seem like I always have trouble with the way they fit but these fit better then expected and at the price I can't beat it. Will be buying more in the future
"I bought these shoes for my husband who works in a hospital.  He loved them at first,  but the sole started separating from the shoe after two nights of wearing them. I contacted the seller and because we didn't have the original box, they would not let me return them . I have asked for an exchange for just a new pair. Not holding my breathe. These are not worth the price you pay for them."
"I'm not sure what is wrong with these shoes but my feet feel really sore after I walk in them. I'm trying to figure out if they were the wrong type for me, but I like that they are light and have a lot of cushion."
These shoes are way smaller than advertised.  The shoelaces are impossible to tie when using all the holes.  Definitely need to get longer shoelaces if I plan on using these for anything other than city walking.
I love the fit of these shoes but I feel like this pair isn't holding up as long as my old trail runners. I've only had them for a few weeks and I'm noticing a lot of wear for not much time in them. Some stitching is coming loose in corners and the bottom rubber/plastic is wearing down. Although they are extremely comfortable and lightweight. Four stars from me.
I got these because I wanted to get in better shape. I am a heavy person who needed more cushioning during my exercise routine. The fit is great and my feet don't hurt after I workout. I highly recommend these.
"I've bought these shoes (venture series) for years due to their comfort, and removable insole that allows for me to use my orthotics.  I've been very happy with them."
"I bought these as walking/jogging shoes and I've only done about three miles in them so far. I just did a walk around the neighborhood to see how they'd feel. They have a lot of heel and ankle support and the gel insoles did a good job keeping my feet from hurting. I haven't gotten up to jogging speed yet, but I suspect they'll do well."
"Comfortable and supportive as I'm on my feet all day in the classroom and these fit my budget too. I would choose something else for serious hiking or trail running but for daily, everyday wear these are great."
"I wear a 11,5 wide and these fit perfect. Very comfortable, very light but well made. I also really like shoelaces since they don't come undone like most of the others. There's a Loy to like snout this shoe,"
I love these and will buy more.  I think this is a great deal for the price.  I use them on my treadmill everyday.  The older shoes I was using would give me heel blisters so I had to apply 3x3 bandages each day.  Both are exactly the same size.  I also love them for trail hiking.  I get out of the city 3 to 3 times a week to go hiking.  At my age (73) good traction is important when hiking and these fit that bill.
Was impressed at how well they fit. Very comfortable right out of the box as well. I'm a diabetic and I have to be very careful with my feet. These shoes are very comfortable when I walk 10-15 miles in a day. Thanks.
"I ordered the 4E size, not only because I have fairly wide feet but also because of the reviews. Good thing I did, these fit perfectly! I would suggest ordering at least 2E (if available) even if you consider your foot to be normal width, as seen on other reviews these shoes do indeed seem to run narrow in the middle. With that said I'm very happy with them. I walk a lot for exercise and have also started to run a bit, and needed to replace my shoes for this purpose. These ASICS are lightweight but still provide plenty of support, and are not nearly as warm as my previous shoes. Great value for the price. I would have only given 4 stars because of the narrow fit, but since I read the reviews and selected the wider version, the fit for me is excellent so my rating is as well!"
These are great shoes but run somewhat small. Did keep the shoes but now I wish I had not. 11.5 might have been just right. I purchased another brand of all purpose workout shoes size 11 and they were just fine.
Shoes are comfy and broke in fast but I have had them less then 3 months and they are already totally demolished and need replaced. Good shoe for the cost but don't expect them to make it for any span of time if you walk regularly like I do!
this is about my 30th pair of ASICS since i was 20 years old.  great running shoe and especially love the trail runner. you can always find a mid level shoe at a reasonable price and they are durable and comfortable.
"These shoes are wonderful for my feet. I'm pigeon toed, and I pronate, and ASICS tend to be the best for my feet. I can run for a while and not suffer any foot discomfort. I typically pair these with non-cotton running socks. I even just bought another pair in a different color in a Lightning Deal I like these so much! My last pair are now my walking around shoes, and when I wear these out, I'll retire them similarly. They are remarkably durable shoes. I definitely would buy, but I don't really recommend just buying shoes online: go get your feet fitted at a running store and find the perfect pair. If these fit you, though, you won't be disappointed."
These are my favorite shoes. They seem to work very well for me. I jog and walk through the out the day and also work on my feet 8-10 hrs a day and they hold up better than any other shoes I have bought.
I returned this item for a refund. The area above my toes was way too tight and actually painful. I'm 63 years old and have never had a pair of shoes so uncomfortable. I'd recommend shoes made by Vasque.
I found the arch support to be too far back inside the shoe. The arch support was placed in between my arch and my heel. This made the shoe very uncomfortable to wear.
This is the first time I ordered running shoes via Amazon.  The shoe runs on the small side.  I normally wear a size 9 1/2 and I ordered a size 10 and it fits perfectly.<br/>Very happy with this purchase.
"Love these shoes. Have sworn by Asics since running track in HS in the 80's. Great value, Great shoe for casual running. The fit was perfect. Lots of shock absorption. my old knees/shins/back appreciates."
"A great price for a good fitting, comfortable shoe.  I have size 13 feet, so I prefer to get black or dark grey shoes, so it doesn't look like I'm wearing pontoons for shoes.  These are well worth the price, and not too flashy, which I like. I usually wear NB or Merrell trail type shoes, and these seem to be just as good at half the price."
This is a running shoe that I have owned previously which was made in China.  This shoe was made in Vietnam and appears to have been made with a little less material but fits my foot size and is still comfortable to wear.
